Strong passwords are important protections to help you have safer online transactions.

### Keys to password strength: length and complexity

An ideal password is long and has letters, punctuation, symbols, and numbers.

* Whenever possible, use at least 14 characters or more.
* The greater the variety of characters in your password, the better.
* Use the entire keyboard, not just the letters and characters you use or see most often.
