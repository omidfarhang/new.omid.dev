Three basic types of firewalls are available for you to choose from:  

* Software firewalls
* Hardware routers
* Wireless routers

To determine which type of firewall is best for you, answer these questions and record your answers:  

1. How many computers will use the firewall?
2. What operating system do you use? (This might be a version of Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, or Linux.)

That's it. You are now ready to think about what type of firewall you want to use. There are several options, each with its own pros and cons.  

List of Different Firewalls
----------------------------

### Software firewalls

Â Software firewalls are a good choice for single computers, and they work well with several operation systems. (Windows Vista and Windows XP both have a built-in firewall too.)

**Pros**

* Does not require additional hardware.
* Does not require additional computer wiring.
* A good option for single computers.

**Cons**

* Additional cost: Most software firewalls cost money.
* Installation and configuration might be required to get started.
* One copy is typically required for each computer.  
  
### Hardware routers

Hardware routers are a good choice for home networks that will connect to the Internet.

**Pros**

* Hardware routers usually have at least four network ports to connect multiple computers together.
* Provide firewall protection for multiple computers.

**Cons**

* Require wiring, which can clutter your desktop area.

### Wireless routers

If you have or plan to use a wireless network, you need a wireless router.

**Pros**

* Wireless routers allow you to connect computers, portable computers, personal desk assistants, and printers without wiring.
* Wireless routers are excellent for connecting notebook computers to the Internet and networks.

**Cons**

* Wireless devices broadcast information using radio signals that can be intercepted by someone outside of your home (if they have the right equipment).
* You might have to pay for extra equipment.
* Not all wireless routers come equipped with a built-in firewall, so you might have to purchase one separately.
