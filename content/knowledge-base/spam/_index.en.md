Spam is any kind of unwanted online communication.

The most common form of spam is unwanted e-mail. You can also get text message spam, [instant message spam](/knowledge-base/safety-tips/instant-messaging) (sometimes known as spim), and [social networking]({{< ref "/knowledge-base/safety-tips/social-networking" >}}) spam.

Some spam is annoying but harmless. However, some spam is part of an identity theft scam or another kind of fraud. Identity theft spam is often called a [phishing scam]({{< ref "/knowledge-base/security/phishing/How-to-recognize-phishing-e-mails-or-links" >}}).

To protect yourself against e-mail spam, use e-mail software with built-in spam filtering. For a general guideline on protecting yourself from e-mail spams, please refer to the “[Checklist: Protecting your business, your employees and your customers]({{< ref "/knowledge-base/spam/checklist" >}})”.
