**Astrix** (‘_Avi Shmailov_ – אסטריקס) is a Psychedelic Trance DJ and producer specialising in the sub-genre  of Full On Psychedelic Trance.

He was born in Russia in 1981 and grew up in Tel Aviv, Israel. He began recording music under the name Astrix in 1997, sometimes misconceived to be taken from the “Asterix” comic books. An interview on UK clubbing website Harderfaster.net revealed the name was chosen for simply sounding good, and not directly influenced by anything in particular.

In 2006 Astrix reached #41 (+34 raise) in DJMag's “Top 100 DJs” yearly rank along with raise of several other Israeli musicians (the highest being Infected Mushroom ranked #12) marking significant worldwide popularisation of Israeli electronic music scene.

In 2007 Astrix reached to #18

#### Early career

![astrix1](/images/2008/04/astrix1-300x240.jpg) Astrix started as a DJ in 1995 playing alternative and 1980s music. It was during this time that he learned about electronic music. In 1997 he began his first in-house studio recordings using a personal computer. He discovered trance in 1997 after being invited to a Trance party. “At first it was a very new and strange experience for me and I couldn't find myself, but I was impressed by the energy and the impact that the music had made on the people at the party.” At the beginning of his career in the late 1990s he produced tracks in the “nitzhonot” style of trance, an uplifting, anthemic off-shoot of Goa trance. His first tracks were “In Peace” and “Eakhis World,” which both appeared on the well-known nitzhonot compilation “Ptzatzot 3.”

During the late 1990s and into the early 2000s he continued in this style and collaborated with several major Israeli trance artists such as Yahel and the Eyal and Oren Barkan. In 2001 he collaborated with Alien Project on the album “Midnight Sun,” which marked his switch from nitzhonot to full-on psytrance.

#### Musical style

![astrix2](/images/2008/04/astrix2-225x300.jpg) Astrix's music is known for his solid, driving basslines and ascending melodies. It is very uplifting and,   as far as psychedelic trance goes, fairly “hard” and is also usually played during sunrise and the morning at outdoor trance parties. Many would consider his style to be a crossover between “full-on” and the “clubbier” end of Trance, exemplfied by his Psychedelic Academy Mix.

#### Influences

Astrix is musically influenced by Infected Mushroom. “I look up to them for inspiration and for some kind of spiritual fuel as it were.” Other influences include Linkin Park and Tiësto. “I also have a love for mainstream bands like Linkin Park, and for ‘club personality’ I like Tiësto, he inspires me very much to see how well you can mix business with music and how big you can become from something that was so small in the beginning.”
