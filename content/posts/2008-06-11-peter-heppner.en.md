**Peter Heppner** (born 1967 in Hamburg) was the lead singer for the German electronica/synth pop band Wolfsheim, and has collaborated with many other electronic music acts, such as Paul van Dyk, Schiller, and Goethes Erben.

Although he's been active in Wolfsheim since 1987, his first commercial success was in 1991 releasing the single “The sparrows and the nightingales”. In 1998 he had a big charts success doing a song with 80's star Joachim Witt, releasing the single “Die Flut”. In the years following, his notability as a singer increased. Collaborating with the electronic music project Schiller, he reached charts positions in 2004 with the songs “Dream of you” and “Leben… I feel you”. In the same year, he released the song “Wir sind wir” together with Paul van Dyk. Although the song was controversial because of its message (which could be interpreted as nationalist), the artists recorded another version together with the Filmorchester Babelsberg for the Day of German Unity on October 3rd, 2005 in Potsdam. A more recent project with Mila Mar and Kim Sanders from Culture Beat spawned the single “Aus Gold”, intended to support Afghanian poorhouses together with the Deutsches Rotes Kreuz.

Heppner will release a first solo-album later in 2008 through Warner Music Germany. The news was announced by the official Peter Heppner fanclub on December 24th, when the website went officially online. For Heppner it will be the first time he goes completely solo after having collaborated with such artists as Girl Under Glass, Umbra Et Imago, Joachim Witt, Schiller, Goethes Erben, Alice II, Paul van Dyk, Milu & Kim Sanders and with Jose Alvarez Brill.
