Spam is any kind of unwanted online communication.

The most common form of spam is unwanted e-mail. You can also get text message spam, [instant message spam](/knowledge-base/safety-tips/instant-messaging) (sometimes known as spim), and [social networking](/2009/01/13/11-tips-for-social-networking-safety/) spam.

Some spam is annoying but harmless. However, some spam is part of an identity theft scam or another kind of fraud. Identity theft spam is often called a [phishing scam](/2009/01/13/phishing-emails/).

To protect yourself against e-mail spam, use e-mail software with built-in spam filtering. For a general guideline on protecting yourself from e-mail spams, please refer to the “[Checklist: Protecting your business, your employees and your customers](/2009/01/13/spam-checklist/)”.
