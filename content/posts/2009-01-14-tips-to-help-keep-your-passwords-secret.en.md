Treat your passwords with as much care as you treat the information that they protect.

Use [strong passwords]({{< ref "/knowledge-base/passwords" >}}) to log on to your computer and to any site where you enter your credit card number, or any financial or personal information—including social networking sites.

1. **Never provide your password over e-mail or in response to an e-mail request.**
    * Internet “phishing” scams use fraudulent e-mail messages to entice you to reveal your user names and passwords, steal your identity, and more. [Learn more about phishing scams]({{< ref "/knowledge-base/security/phishing/how-to-recognize-phishing-e-mails-or-links" >}}).
2. **Do not type passwords on computers that you do not control**
    * Computers such as those in Internet cafes, computer labs, kiosk systems, conferences, and airport lounges should be considered unsafe for any personal use other than anonymous Internet browsing.
    * Cyber criminals can purchase keystroke logging devices which gather information typed on a computer, including passwords.
3. **Don’t reveal passwords to others**
    * Keep your passwords hidden from friends or family members (especially children) who could pass them on to other, less trustworthy individuals.
4. **Protect any recorded passwords**
    * Don’t store passwords on a file in your computer, because criminals will look there first.
    * Keep your record of the passwords you use in a safe, secure place.
5. **Use more than one password**
    * Use different passwords for different Web sites and services.
