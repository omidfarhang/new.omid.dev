Since 2004, he has released two studio albums as well as one live album, two remix CDs and one DVD featuring a live concert, and a number of interviews. Through his short career, Matisyahu has teamed up with some of the biggest names in reggae production including Bill Laswell and duo Sly & Robbie.

Since his debut, Matisyahu has received positive reviews from both rock and reggae outlets. Most recently, he was named Top Reggae Artist of 2006 by _Billboard_ as well as being named a spokesperson for Kenneth Cole.

#### Biography

##### Personal life

[![matisyahu123](/images/2010/09/matisyahu1235b35d.jpg?w=300 "matisyahu123")](/images/2010/09/matisyahu1235b35d.jpg) Matisyahu was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania; his family eventually settled in White Plains, New York. He was brought up a Reconstructionist Jew and sometimes performed under the alias MC Truth for MC Mystic's Soulfari band. He spent some time as a young man as a self-professed “deadhead,” taking hallucinogens and following the rock band Phish on tour.

At 16, Matisyahu took part in a semester-long program that offers students first-hand exploration of Jewish heritage at the Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, Israel. His experiences there significantly affected his feelings towards Judaism eventually leading to his decision to adopt Orthodox Judaism, becoming a Baal Teshuva around 2001. Initially he found his way to the Carlebach Shul on the West Side of Manhattan. Matisyahu then found his way to Chabad of Washington Square. He finished high school at a wilderness program in Bend, Oregon. Following this seminal event, Matisyahu began playing with the Jewish band Pey Dalid.

From 2001 through most of his early career until July 2007, Matisyahu was a member of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. However, as of 17 July 2007, he told the _Miami New Times_ in an interview that he no longer “necessarily” identifies with the Lubavitch movement. In the interview, he stated that “…the more I'm learning about other types of Jews, I don't want to exclude myself. I felt boxed in.” Additionally in the autumn of 2007 while on a family vacation spent primarily in Jerusalem's Nachlaot neighborhood he has expressed interest in another Hasidic sect, that of Karlin. As of November 2007 he has confirmed a preference to pray at the Karliner synagogue in Boro Park where the custom is to ecstatically scream prayers; however he continues to reside in Crown Heights because of his wife's affinity for the community.

Soon after his adoption of hasidism, Matisyahu began studying Torah at Hadar Hatorah, a yeshiva for returnees to Judaism where he wrote and recorded his first album. He counts Bob Marley, Phish, God Street Wine and Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach among his musical inspirations and gives credit to Rabbi Simon Jacobson's book _Toward a Meaningful Life_ for the lyrical inspiration to _Youth'_s title track. As part of his faith, he does not perform in concert on Friday nights in observance of the Jewish Sabbath. An exception to this occurred at a 2007 concert in Fairbanks, Alaska, which he allowed because the sun didn't set until 2am.

Matisyahu is married to Tahlia; the couple have two sons. He also has a younger sister named Julie.

##### Career

[![matisyahu_416](/images/2010/09/matisyahu_4165b35d.jpg?w=204 "matisyahu_416")](/images/2010/09/matisyahu_4165b35d.jpg) In 2004, Matisyahu, after having signed with JDub Records, a not-for-profit record label that promotes Jewish musicians, released his first album, _Shake Off the Dust…Arise_. At the time a relatively unknown musician, he did not rise to prominence until Bonnaroo 2005, when Trey Anastasio of the band Phish invited him a guest spot on his set. This would prove to be the event that launched his career.

His live album, _Live at Stubb's_, released in 2005, was recorded at a concert in Austin, Texas. This concert album, and _Youth_, his second studio album, both received critical and popular acclaim. Each album marks significant changes in Matisyahu's style, most markedly between _Stubb's_ and _Youth_, when more rock music influences are evident. Since his second two albums became popular, _Shake off the Dust_ has steadily risen in demand, fetching prices upwards of $30USD on online auction sites such as Ebay.

Throughout 2005 and 2006, Matisyahu toured extensively in the United States, Canada and Europe; and made a number of stops in Israel, including a performance as the supporting act for Sting in June 2006. In late 2006, Matisyahu released _No Place to Be_, a remix album featuring re-recordings and remixes of songs from all three of his earlier albums, as well as a cover of “Message in a Bottle” by The Police.

[![matisyahu 636](/images/2010/09/matisyahu6365b35d.jpg?w=300 "matisyahu 636")](/images/2010/09/matisyahu6365b35d.jpg) The live version of the song _King Without a Crown_, broke into the Modern Rock Top 10 in 2006. The accompanying video and album, _Youth_, produced by Bill Laswell, were released on March 7, 2006. On March 16, _Youth_ was _Billboard_ magazine's number-one Digital Album. In 2006, Matisyahu appeared once again at Bonnaroo, this time performing a solo set in front of an estimated crowd of over 10,000 people.

In Spring 2006, right before the release of _Youth_, Matisyahu cut ties with his managers at JDub Records, which resulted in some controversy due to Matisyahu's role in the founding of the label. Contrary to popular belief, JDub managed his act, but was not his record label.

In January 2007, Matisyahu performed in an impromptu concert at the Park City Film Music Festival in Park City, Utah, while in Park City for the Slamdance Film Festival. Matisyahu's music is part of the winning documentary film “Unsettled” which won at the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival.

In April 2007 it was confirmed that Matisyahu, along with Los Angeles based jam band Particle and British ska band The English Beat, would open for 311 on their Summer Unity Tour 2007. The tour ran from late June to late August and included shows all across the country.

In June 2007, Matisyahu played at the Waikiki Shell in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he received a triple encore. His opening bands follow in order of appearance were Madina Lake, Plain White T's and Yellowcard.

In July 2007, it was reported that Matisyahu had begun writing new songs for his third album.According to Billboard.com, Matisyahu's new album, entitled _Light_, is expected to be released sometime in early 2009.

In a 2008 rockumentary, Call+Response, headed by Justin Dillon, Matisyahu performed “Indestructible” and “Redemption Song” in support of the film's cause: a movement against current slavery and human trafficking.

Matisyahu has planns to release his new album, “LIGHT” April, 21 2009.

#### Artistic style

[![Matisyahu212](/images/2010/09/matisyahu2125b35d.jpg?w=300 "Matisyahu212")](/images/2010/09/matisyahu2125b35d.jpg) The music, developed partly with his backing band Roots Tonic has a unique sound, mixing reggae, traditional rap, and guitar solos typical of rock music. He sometimes performs with Kenny Muhammad, a Muslim beatboxer. Matisyahu's major label debut album was produced by avant-garde musician and producer Bill Laswell, with minor contribution by pop producers Jimmy Douglass and the Ill Factor.

Most of his songs are almost entirely in English with just a few words of Hebrew and Yiddish sprinkled in. His reggae vocal style is along the lines of traditional Rasta Roots stylings mixed with dub sound. The easiest comparison would be similar to the conscious and cultural sides of Buju Banton, Snow, Sizzla, Capleton, or Junior Kelly, but with the upbeat message of Luciano, Bushman and Everton Blender, and vocal dexterity of Barrington Levy. The production of the tracks draws from King Tubby, Augustus Pablo, Mikey Dread, and Linval Thompson. Similarities to the Foundation Sound of the late 1970s and 1980s would be accurate, and comparisons to Morgan Heritage likewise, would not be wrong.

However, he mixes in contemporary stylings of rap and beatboxing, similar to Sublime, as well as the traditional Hazzan style of Jewish cantors and Hasidic nigunim. The generally critical _New York Times_‘ Kelefa Sanneh notes that “His sound owes a lot to early dancehall reggae stars like Barrington Levy and Eek-a-Mouse.” The _Chicago Tribune'_s Kevin Pang has described a Matisyahu performance as “soul-shaking brand of dancehall reggae, a show that captures both the jam band vibe of Phish and the ska-punk of Sublime.” Reviewers generally agree that Matisyahu may disappoint reggae purists, but acknowledge the unique blend of musical traditions that Matisyahu harnesses generally please the people who see his performances. Matisyahu's style has been compared to _Jew da Maccabi_, an Orthodox Jew from Florida who includes religious lyrics within a musical style derived from hip-hop. Matisyahu's style has also been compared to Jordan Chaviv, an Orthodox Jew from Canada whose lyrics are also inspired by Jewish teachings.

Matisyahu has stated that “All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chasidism teaches that music is ‘the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't.”

#### Origin of his name

 _[![matisyahu](/images/2010/09/matisyahu5b35d.jpg?w=300 "matisyahu")](/images/2010/09/matisyahu5b35d.jpg) Matisyahu_ is an Ashkenazi Hebrew and Yiddish pronunciation of the Biblical name Matthew (מתתיהו). The same Hebrew name corresponds to the name Mattathias — which is sometimes used as a translation of the name of the 2nd century B.C.E. Jewish high priest of the Maccabees.

Matisyahu Miller explained the origin of his personal use of the name in an interview in _Kosher Spirit Magazine_ (a publication by OK Kosher Certification) as follows: His full secular name is Matthew Paul Miller, and the legal Hebrew name he received at his brit milah (circumcision ceremony) at eight days of age was forgotten. In Hebrew school it was assumed to be Matisyahu because of the connection between Matthew and Matisyahu. The original certificate from the brit was later located and he discovered that the actual name given at the brit was the Yiddish name “Feivish Hershel”. He was advised by his rabbis to continue using the Hebrew name that he had grown up with.
