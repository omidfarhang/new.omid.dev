It's the second Tuesday of the month and there are important updates being released.

From Microsoft, of course, but also from Adobe.

There's a [critical security issue in Adobe Flash Player](http://www.itpro.co.uk/618487/adobe-software-hit-again-by-hackers) 10.0.32.18 and earlier.

It's important that organizations deploy these updates before the Christmas holiday reduces IT staffing. Fortunately, this patch cycle is as early as can be landing on the 8th so there's still time to test and deploy.
