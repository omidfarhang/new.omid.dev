This is a new one: bribeware. They’ll pay you a dollar to install their product.

Nice idea, but unfortunately in this case it comes bundled with malware. We detect it as C4DLMedia, a group of installers that include adware and agents that change browser home pages. It’s considered a “moderate” risk.

I wonder if Microsoft considered this for VISTA.

C4DL Media might have a marketing problem with the dollar bribe though. In places where a dollar is worth enough to make this worth the effort there probably isn’t any Internet connectivity.
