I've been saying this for a [long time](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/apr/22/whyyoushouldsupportyourlo). P2P networks are [have the risk](http://vimeo.com/8063230) of accidently getting something you really don’t want…

> Matthew White, of Sacramento, California, has found himself in a rather unfortunate situation; he's been accused of downloading child [pornography](http://www.switched.com/tag/porn). On the advice of his public defender, White is pleading guilty in hopes of cutting his potential 20-year sentence down to three and a half years. After serving his time, White will have to serve 10 years of probation and register as a sex offender. 

> What makes this unfortunate is that the 22-year-old White claims he downloaded the child pornography on accident from the file-sharing service [LimeWire](http://www.switched.com/tag/limewire). According to White, he was attempting to download a &#8216;Girls Gone Wild' video two years ago, but when he opened the files, instead discovered images of underage girls. White claims to have immediately deleted the images and never looked back — at least until the [FBI](http://www.switched.com/tag/fbi) showed up at his door a year later.
