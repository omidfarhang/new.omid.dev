It's not a huge surprise that we are seeing some malware spam runs where the malicious attachment attempts to portray itself as a **Christmas Greeting** of some sort.

Here's an example from today (md5: C670165AE6DFA8318F0EA795B1D3AD55). This one is actually a Zapchast (IRC bot variant).

The &#8220;Christmas Card&#8221; requires it's own &#8220;special version&#8221; of Flash to be installed — flashplayer2009.exe — which is the malware itself.

Once ready, it will display this friendly message written in Universal Gibberish.
