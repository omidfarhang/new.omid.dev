Almost the entire year 2009, the battle for the first place on phishing targets took place between Ebay and Chase Bank. Most of the time, the Chase Bank was on top of the most phished brands.

In December, the situation was changed: Now PayPal is the most phished brand (32205 unique URLs) followed from far away by the Chase Bank (25901 unique URLs) and Ebay (18738 unique URLs).

Why this change? Most probably it has to do with the fact that a lot of people are using PayPal to pay for Christmas presents.

Be safe during the winter holidays and always write the address of PayPal and other online banks in the browser by yourself and never click on links in emails.
