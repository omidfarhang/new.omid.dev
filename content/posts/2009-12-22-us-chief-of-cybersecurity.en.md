After months of negotiations, US President Barack Obama has finally chosen a Chief of CyberSecurity &#8211; Mr Howard A Schmidt. Confirmation of the appointment is expected shortly.

Mr Schmidt, who previously served with the Bush administration as a cyber security official, comes to the job with an impressively lengthy list of credentials.

The new Chief will essentially be the administration's go-to man for any coordinated efforts to deal with cyber threats and will be reporting to the National Security Council.

After a fairly eventful year of cyber attacks and the related media frenzy, it's nice to see someone finally willing to take up the challenge of dealing with it all. It also promises an interesting 2010.

Best of luck to the new Cyber Czar.
