For those of you that are having to put up with looking after your parents over Christmas: Would you much rather selfishly indulge yourselves with partying? A kindly spammer has a very seasonal Christmas Eve message offering to make this the last year that you will have to “put up” with the burdens of family elders.

But be careful that your own children don’t read this.

Technically this may be a legitimate emailing within the U.S.A. under the CanSpam legisation. But it certainly does not seem to be quite in the spirit of Christmas.
