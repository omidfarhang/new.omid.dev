Seal Shield, a Jacksonville, Fla., company that makes washable computer keyboards and mice, said it will introduce the world’s first washable cell phone at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.

The company’s washable mice, keyboards and TV remotes can be cleaned in a dishwasher.

This might be good. I have three 20-something step children who have discovered that cell phones as we have come to know them do not survive being dropped in toilets.
