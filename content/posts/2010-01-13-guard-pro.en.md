Guard Pro will show system scan results that report numerous infections, which are all fake, and will not remove the supposed infections until the user buys the product. Do not fall for this, it is a complete scam, Guard Pro is the infection itself. Guard Pro will also show system warnings and alerts stating the PC is infected or under attack and prompts the user to buy the software.
