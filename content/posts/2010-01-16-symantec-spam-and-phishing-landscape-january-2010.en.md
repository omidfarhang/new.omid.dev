  * With respect to the average size of the messages, the 2kb – 5kb message size category increased by seven percent, while the 5kb – 10kb message size category decreased by six percent in December 2009.
  * With respect to all spam categories, health and product spam have increased and now account for 52 percent of all spam messages.
