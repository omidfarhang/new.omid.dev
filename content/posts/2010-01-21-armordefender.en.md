ArmorDefender is phony security program that trick people into buying the software with false security warnings and system scans. By displaying false system warnings, pop-up alerts warning of infections, and system scans that state the PC has numerous infections, cyber thieves rip people off by demanding the user buy the program to remove the supposed infections.
