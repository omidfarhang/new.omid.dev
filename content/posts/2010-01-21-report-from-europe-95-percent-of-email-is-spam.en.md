The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) has released a report that says 95 percent of all email is now spam.

The report was based on surveying last year of email traffic by about 100 service providers in 30 countries.

ENISA Executive Director Dr. Udo Helmbrecht said:

_“Spam remains an unnecessary, time consuming and costly burden for Europe. Given the number of spam messages observed, I can only conclude more dedicated efforts must be undertaken._  
_  
_  
_“Email providers should be better at monitoring spam and identifying the source. Policy-makers and regulatory authorities should clarify the conflicts between spam-filtering, privacy, and obligation to deliver.”_
