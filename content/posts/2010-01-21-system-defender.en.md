System Defender is a rogue antispyware program, or a PC infection made to look like real security software. System Defender is a scam designed to trick people out of their money.

If your PC has been infected with System Defender, you will most likely experience the following symptoms:

  * System scans that report numerous infections, yet requires purchase of System Defender before it will remove the infections (These are fictitious scan results)
  * Alerts and Pop-Up system warnings stating the PC is infected and recommend purchase of System Defender (These warnings are fake)
  * Web browser redirecting to random websites (these websites are owned by cyber thieves and will further infect your PC)
  * System Defender will prevent other programs from opening, stating they are infected (The programs are not infected)

System Defender is a very serious computer infection and should be removed from infected machines immediately.
