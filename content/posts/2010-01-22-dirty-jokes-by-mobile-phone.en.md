The Danwei web site (Chinese media, advertising, and urban life) is carrying a rippingly funny blog piece by Alice Xin Liu about a recent Chinese government program that would have China Mobile monitor mobile telephone text transmissions for conversations of a sexual nature. Offenders’ (messaging) service would be cut off until they wrote a “self-criticism.”

Xin Lilu said bloggers in China are having a ball with the idea that the government is trying to censor dirty jokes, which apparently are a significant part of the culture of Chinese people (as if they were any different than the rest of us).

The Chinese language, however, is structured in such a way that machine filtering encounters even more complexity than it does in other languages.

_“Similar to filtering for the Internet, dirty phrases are targeted, but with the make up of Chinese sentences, two completely unrelated characters could be strung together to make something a lot ruder,”_ she says.

She said that one student blogged that after he returned from dinner at a friend’s home, he sent the text message to his buddy: “you mom’s stewed post [pork?] is excellent.” The next day he couldn’t send text messages.

There is a Chinese euphemism “meat stick,” but you can read Xin Lilu’s original blog post for that discussion.

Dirty jokes are part of the fabric of life she concludes. _“…sex is a kind of entertainment. Furthermore, it’s quite important as a form [of] entertainment.”_

Thank you Alice.
