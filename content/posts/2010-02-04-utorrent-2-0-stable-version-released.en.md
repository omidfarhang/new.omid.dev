Release Notes:

  * Added UDP tracker support!
  * uTP has been improved significantly 1.8.5, with many bugs fixed and performance improvements. It can be found in the preferences as &#8220;Enable bandwidth management&#8221; (but don’t worry, you can still control caps!).
  * The setup dialog has been overhauled to make it much easier to use and with a built-in speed test. More presets were added and it automatically scales settings for high-upload connections.
  * A new transfer cap feature has been added to track bandwidth usage, along with graphs to show your usage.

_Note – The program asks you to install Ask Toolbar which you can ignore during installation._
