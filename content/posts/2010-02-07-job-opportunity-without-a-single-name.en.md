Today we received some job hiring emails that looked like this:

It has been formatted nicely and appears to have come from a large job search website.

The message reads as follows:

You might be tempted to try out your luck with such a generous offer, but before doing that, the lack of your name and absence of the hiring company’s name should arouse suspicion about this mail.

The Reply-To field in the mail header tells another story, that the sender is probably not from a well set-up business. Otherwise why would they send the email a main website address, but have you reply to an AOL account?

In fact, this is a typical example of money mule hiring scams that are constantly seen in spam messages.

Always think twice before responding when you are contacted by a potential employer, especially when there’s no mention of the name of the company that is actually interested.
