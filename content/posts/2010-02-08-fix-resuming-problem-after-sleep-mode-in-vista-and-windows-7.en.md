Putting laptop in **sleep mode** is a common thing that we do to save power and perform our work at a later stage without much delay. But for some users there is a problem while they try to resume from sleep mode.

As the resuming begins, a blank screen appears with a mouse pointer and stays until you press any key or click the mouse. This problem may be fixed by a HotFix named **KB958685** released by Microsoft for Vista and Windows7 users and should be only used if you are facing this problem.

For more information on this HotFix, visit [Microsoftâ€™s site](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/958685/).

**Download**: [KB958685](http://support.microsoft.com/hotfix/KBHotfix.aspx?kbnum=958685&kbln=en-us).
