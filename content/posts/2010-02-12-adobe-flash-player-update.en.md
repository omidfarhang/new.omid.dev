Adobe has published a [security bulletin](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-06.html "Security update available for Adobe Flash Player") about security vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. In all versions up to the recent 10.0.42.34 Flash objects could evade the Sandbox which would allow for unauthorized cross domain requests. The vulnerability is rated critical. The updated version 10.0.45.2 as well of a fixed build of Adobe AIR 1.5.3.1930 is available in the [flash download center](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ "Adobe Flash Player Download Center") and the [air download center](http://get.adobe.com/air/ "Adobe AIR Download Center"), respectively. Users should apply the update ASAP and administrators in companies should roll the fixed software out soon, too.
