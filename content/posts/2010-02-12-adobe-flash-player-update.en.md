Adobe has published a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-06.html" target="_blank" title="Security update available for Adobe Flash Player">security bulletin</a> about security vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. In all versions up to the recent 10.0.42.34 Flash objects could evade the Sandbox which would allow for unauthorized cross domain requests. The vulnerability is rated critical. The updated version 10.0.45.2 as well of a fixed build of Adobe AIR 1.5.3.1930 is available in the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" title="Adobe Flash Player Download Center">flash download center</a> and the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/air/" target="_blank" title="Adobe AIR Download Center">air download center</a>, respectively. Users should apply the update ASAP and administrators in companies should roll the fixed software out soon, too.
