Advanced Defender is fake security software that tricks people into thinking it's legitimate antispyware software in hopes they will pay for the product.

Advanced Defender is a potentially dangerous and extremely frustrating PC infection that should be removed immediately. If Advanced Defender has infected your computer you may notice the following symptoms:

  * System scans that report numerous infections, yet requires purchase of Advanced Defender before it will remove the infections (These are fictitious scan results)
  * Alerts and Pop-Up system warnings stating the PC is infected and recommend purchase of Advanced Defender (These warnings are fake)
  * Web browser redirecting to random websites (these websites are owned by cyber thieves and will further infect your PC)
  * Advanced Defender will prevent other programs from opening, stating they are infected (The programs are not infected)
