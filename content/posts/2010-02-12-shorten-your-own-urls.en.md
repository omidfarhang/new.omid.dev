_“YOURLS is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (a la TinyURL). You can make it private or public, you can pick custom keyword URL. It comes with its own API.”_  
<a href="http://yourls.org/" target="_blank">http://yourls.org/</a>

It’s installed on your web server (needs PHP 4.3 or better and MYSQL 4.1 with mod_rewrite enabled.)

 _“Benefits:</p> 

1. Not reliant on third party service  
2. Sends link juice to your domain, not a service provider  
3. Customize your short links  
4. Build your brand (showing your URL)”</i>
