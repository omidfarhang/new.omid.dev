A survey of 54,000 households (129,000 people) commissioned by National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) last year found that 30 percent of U.S residents did not use the Internet at home or at work.

The study, based on Census Bureau work, found that 64 percent of households had connections. In 2007, only 51 did.

The NTIA researchers found that of those without connections, 38 percent said they didn’t need Internet and 26 percent said it was too expensive. In rural areas, 11 percent said they didn’t have any Internet access available. In urban areas, one percent said they couldn’t get it.
