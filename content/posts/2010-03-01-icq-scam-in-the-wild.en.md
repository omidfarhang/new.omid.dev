I have received a message this morning from an ICQ account with the following text written in UTF-8 and plain text:

_The message from ICQ.com_  
_\***\***\****_  
_Hello._  
_ICQ.com: we Remind you that all ICQ numbers which have not passed activation, 1.1.2010 will be removed from a server without restoration possibility. _  
_The status of yours ICQ numbers: NOT activated. _  
_For activation send SMS on number 8353 with the text 144444_  
_In the reciprocal message you receive acknowledgement on activation and your password from number._  
_ICQ.com Together with AOL.com_

One should never reply to such messages. A few observations which show why:

1.   The text is written in a very bad English language.

Seeing the details of the user, the reason gets clear:

No comments…

2.   1.1.2010 is already in the past. So did the spammer send the message too late?

There are only two things to do with this kind of messages:  
1. Block the user by clicking Deny

2. Forget about it.
