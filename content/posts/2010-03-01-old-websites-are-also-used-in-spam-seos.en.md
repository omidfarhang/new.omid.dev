A few days ago, I blogged saying that [Old websites donâ€™t die they just get infected](http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2010/02/trojiframe-dy-old-websites-dont-die.html) the other scenario is that they become part of a spammers SEO campaign.

Working today, I went to check to see if the local police authority had cleaned up their old web page. So I [wgetted](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) the file and scanned it. It was no longer infected (hooray!) but the file was quite big. Opening the file in lynx (a simple web  
browser) I saw:

I saw that now instead of malware appended to the bottom of the web page we now see spam advertising Meds.

If you are no longer using/updating your web site think about deactivating it because having malware and/or spam on it will impact on your brand image.
