_In Additional to my last Post_: <http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2010/03/free-fakeav-at-virus-total-thats-not.html>

[VirusTotal.com](http://www.virustotal.com/) [<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirusTotal.com>] is a brilliant site that helps both public and researchers alike determine if an executable file they have is potentially malicious or not.

Julio Canto (of VirusTotal fame) has noticed that [somebody decided to cash in](http://twitter.com/jcanto/status/9685945726)  on the good name of the site with the following domain:

virus-total(dot)in

Go there, and you’ll see  a message claiming the site is a “free online antivirus scanning service, click SCAN to begin scanning:“

</div>

Hit “Scan”, and it isn’t long before this happens:

</div>

Yes, we have some Rogue Antivirus advertising in the house, to the tune of “Your computer is infected by viruses” complete with the now familiar fake image of your drives and folders:

<div>
  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S4xU-iNMXqI/AAAAAAAABEE/P9Ngvn12hY8/s1600-h/fakevt3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S4xU-iNMXqI/AAAAAAAABEE/P9Ngvn12hY8/s640/fakevt3.jpg" /></a>
</div>

Should you download and run the executable file offered up by the site, you’ll end up with the rogue [Security Tool](http://sites.google.com/site/boelectronic/computer/malware/list-of-common-malwares/securitytool) on your system.

An unfortunate side effect of a scam like this is that the real VirusTotal could start to receive emails from irate victims of the fake site claiming they’ve “infected my PC” – fingers crossed it doesn’t get to that stage

Remember: the REAL domain for VirusTotal is Virustotal.com. Don’t fall for this scam!
