Popular instant messaging, voice chat, and video conferencing client Skype and Skype Lite are no longer available on Windows Mobile devices.

The company says, “We've chosen to withdraw Skype Lite and Skype for Windows Mobile because we want to offer our new customers an improved mobile experience — much like the version that has proved so popular on the iPhone, and which is now available on Symbian phones. Our focus is on providing a rich user experience that allows you to enjoy free Skype-to-Skype and low cost calls as easily on the move as you do at your desktop. <u>We felt that Skype Lite and Skype for Windows Mobile were not offering the best possible Skype experience.</u>“

Replying to a commenter on [WMPoweruser](http://wmpoweruser.com/?p=13689) who said Skype was canceled because hardware manufacturers all have different methods of utilizing the earphones and speakers, Skype's Peter Parkes said, “[The] comment above pretty much nails it. It's been very difficult for us to make the experience consistent across a wide range of Windows devices. However, we have a partnership in place with China Unicom to deliver a new beta version to their WM handsets — where we can work with mobile operators, we'll be able to deliver a Skype experience on the current WM platform which lives up to expectations.”

This news comes just over a week after Skype and Verizon Wireless jointly announced that unlimited Skype-to-Skype calls over 3G will be allowed on certain BlackBerry and Android devices.
