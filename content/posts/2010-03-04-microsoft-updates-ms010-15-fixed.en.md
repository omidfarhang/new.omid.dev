**It won’t work if you have a rootkit infection, but it won’t blue screen your machine either.**

Microsoft has reissued Security Bulletin MS010-15 from last month to work around a problem that had occurred when a WinXP user attempted to install the patch on a machine that was infected with a rootkit. (blue screen, blue screen)

Jerry Bryant, Microsoft’s senior security communications manager lead, writing on the company TechNet blog said that the new installation packages for MS10-015 have new logic that will prevent the security update from installing on rootkit-infected systems. Microsoft also is offering guidance for those with infected machines and a scanning tool that can detect system conditions that will prevent the patch from applying itself.

We described the problem on the Omid's Blog! Feb. 13 “[WinXP users: hold off on installing MS010–15 \[BSOD\]](http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2010/02/winxp-users-hold-off-on-installing.html)”.
