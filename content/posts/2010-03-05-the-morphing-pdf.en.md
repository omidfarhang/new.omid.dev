Just when we thought SEO using Flash was as interesting as SEO poisoning can get, it seems it's getting even sneakier…

Imagine a PDF file posted by someone evil online. Of course, Google being Google, the file is recognized as a PDF.

<div>
  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXoEzVGoI/AAAAAAAABLE/bttA1pld1sM/s1600-h/joe_corvo_3hrsago.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXoEzVGoI/AAAAAAAABLE/bttA1pld1sM/s640/joe_corvo_3hrsago.PNG" /></a>
</div>

And when we open it, it really is a PDF. No evil codes inside, just a good old vanilla PDF file.

<div>
  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXvtp7glI/AAAAAAAABLc/gQu3PBjk7Xg/s1600-h/joe_corvo_pdf.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXvtp7glI/AAAAAAAABLc/gQu3PBjk7Xg/s640/joe_corvo_pdf.PNG" /></a>
</div>

Three hours later… Google still says the file is a PDF. Brod (one of our geeky guys here) is attributing this to Google's cache.

<div>
  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXo2AUz0I/AAAAAAAABLM/cbppifuDriM/s1600-h/joe_corvo_3hrslater.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXo2AUz0I/AAAAAAAABLM/cbppifuDriM/s640/joe_corvo_3hrslater.PNG" /></a>
</div>

But is it really a PDF this time around?

<div>
  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXsrvW8cI/AAAAAAAABLU/S59o3jbQX6c/s1600-h/joe_corvo_html.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXsrvW8cI/AAAAAAAABLU/S59o3jbQX6c/s640/joe_corvo_html.PNG" /></a>
</div>

It morphed! And it even has different topics this time. Topics which, when you follow them, will lead you to another PDF:

<div>
  <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXnHaq9hI/AAAAAAAABK8/AfNkJocIHQY/s1600-h/jaypolhill_pdf.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXnHaq9hI/AAAAAAAABK8/AfNkJocIHQY/s640/jaypolhill_pdf.PNG" /></a>
</div>

At least for a few hours before it becomes…

<div>
  <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXj45jhUI/AAAAAAAABK0/-zZWEQQLadA/s1600-h/jaypolhill_html.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S5FXj45jhUI/AAAAAAAABK0/-zZWEQQLadA/s640/jaypolhill_html.PNG" /></a>
</div>

It's a vicious cycle, but a pretty neat trick. Who would suspect a non-malicious PDF file right? At least before it becomes an HTML file. And the end result is a rogue antivirus scam.
