Exploit code for the the zero-day vulnerability in [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/981374.mspx) has been added to the Metasploit framework. According to an email HD Moore wrote to ZDNet’s Ryan Naraine, the exploit works quite reliable – successful 50% of the times on Windows XP with SP2 and SP3 with IE7 and deactivated Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

The security hole got reported yesterday on Microsoft’s March 2010 [Patch Tuesday](http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2010/03/microsoft-patch-tuesday-march-2010.html). Drive-by-Download-Exploits are likely to appear now as the Metasploit framework is open source and the exploit can now be abused even by script kiddies. Time to change the default browser – Microsoft just released a new [browser choice](http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2010/03/browser-choice.html) screen which allows for exactly that!
