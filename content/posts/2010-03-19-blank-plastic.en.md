We regularly learn of cases where criminals have gained access to credit card numbers via **keyloggers**, **skimmers** or **online hacks**.

Once they have the credit card numbers, they basically have three ways to turn them into cash:

  * Sell them
  * Make fraudulent purchases on them
  * Create real-world cards out of them

To create real-world cards, you need blank cards to start with. These are known in the underground as &#8220;**blank plastic**&#8220;.

And there are online stores for blank plastic. Here are some pictures from one:
