Generally speaking, most website defacements I see tend to look the same with political activist Y decrying political activist Z, or leet hax0rs posting up a mile-long shoutout list to their crew.

This one is, er, a little different – a defacement of what appears to have been a site involved in fish logistics and / or preservation, fish2see(dot)dk. I can only imagine the horror on the face of the site admin who woke up this morning to be confronted by this:

<div>
  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S6f1pnhWtoI/AAAAAAAABXg/R5XocnkMWmM/s1600-h/deadfishhack.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S6f1pnhWtoI/AAAAAAAABXg/R5XocnkMWmM/s400/deadfishhack.jpg" width="400" /></a>
</div>

<div>
  …oh dear.
</div>

The Admin has been notified, but the site is still currently defaced – I wouldn’t advise going there, as the attacker could decide to come back and put something a little more malicious online.
