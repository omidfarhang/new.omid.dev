For the current vulnerability in Internet Explorer 6 and 7 which already gets actively exploited on the net, Microsoft is already testing a patch. The company is still [considering](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2010/03/12/update-on-security-advisory-981374.aspx) whether to release the patch on the regular Patchday or out-of-band.

Meanwhile, a “Fix-it”-solution is available. With some registry changes the affected peers factory in iepeers.dll gets disabled by a mouse click. You can download it from Microsoft’s [knowledgebase](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981374).
