Lots of little newsworthy updates recently . . . they've been well-covered elsewhere, but we wanted to make sure our readers saw them as well.

### Russia: Safe Haven no more?

One of the constant complaints that we hear is “the criminal is probably in Russia”, as an excuse for why a case is not worth investigating. Back on November 11, 2009, we posted a story [The $9 Million World-wide Bank Robbery](http://garwarner.blogspot.com/2009/11/9-million-world-wide-bank-robbery.html), where VIKTOR PLESHCHUK, 28, of St. Petersburg, Russia; SERGEI TŠURIKOV, 25, of Tallinn, Estonia; and OLEG COVELIN, 28, of Chişinău, Moldova were charged with leading the robbery, which actually occurred in 2008. This week the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/04e59450-3552-11df-9cfb-00144feabdc0.html) has revealed that Viktor Pleshchuk was arrested by the FSB. Their story leads with:

> Russia has quietly arrested several suspects in one of the world's biggest cyberbank thefts, raising hopes of a previously unseen level of official co-operation in a country that has been a haven for criminals.

Other sources, for instance [Bank Info Security News](http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/articles.php?art_id=2331) have confirmed that Sergei and Oleg were also arrested by the FSB at the same time.

### Your Federal Friends on Facebook?

Pasquale Manfredi isn't exactly a nice guy. The authorities have wanted to arrest him for some time because of his naughty habits such as assassinating his enemies by shooting a bazooka at their car. [The Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1258369/Pasquale-Manfredi-Facebook-arrest-Mafia-hitman-Scarface-caught.html) says that he also maintained a Facebook account under the name “Georgie”, with Al Pacino's “ScarFace” as his Profile picture. According to [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/17/mafia_suspect_tracked_via_facebook/), authorities used intelligence gathered from his Facebook page to identify his location and successfully make the arrest.

The Associated Press's Richard Lardner followed up with a story about the way MySpace and Facebook are both being used as investigative goldmines. See his story [Break the law and your new ‘friend' may be the FBI](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100316/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/us_feds_on_facebook).

### Twitter Hacker in France

“Hacker Croll” an unemployed 25-year-old hacker who lived with his parents had his moment of fame after breaking into the Twitter accounts of President Obama and Britney Spears. [The AP story](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2010/03/24/technology-eu-france-twitter-hacker_7462754.html?boxes=Homepagebusinessnews) says he was arrested by French police, who have released him to reappear on June 24th for his trial. The hacker calls himself “more of a pirate than a hacker”, and has explained his method to the police. French prosecutor, Jean-Yves Coquillat, says the young man was acting on a bet, and that he is “the sort who likes to claim responsibility for what he's done.” According to an [AFP Story](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ih6sNjp-rSolFFTgPrdvxSZuUPRA) TechCrunch had received more than 300 documents belonging to Twitter employees that were provided by Hacker Croll. Twitter has acknowledged that they seem legitimate.
