Our good friends at Hanoi, Viet Nam, -based security firm Bkis have written about an interesting malcode lure: Trojans masquerading as updates for popular applications such as Adobe, Java or Windows.

The fake updates are distributed with icons of the application they’re impersonating.

Analyst Nguyen Cong Cuong wrote: “In addition, on being executed, they immediately turn on the following services: DHCP client, DNS client, Network share and open port to receive hacker’s commands.”

As a countermeasure, it would be a good idea to ignore any email you receive with a link or attachment that claims to be an update. Use the “updater” or “check for updates” menu choice on the application or Windows implementation that’s installed on your machine.
