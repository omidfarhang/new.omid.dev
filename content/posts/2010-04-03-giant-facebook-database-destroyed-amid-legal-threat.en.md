_New Scientist_ is [reporting](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18721-data-sifted-from-facebook-wiped-after-legal-threats.html) that a massive database culled from the public profiles of 210 million Facebook users has been destroyed before its anticipated — and controversial — release to researchers.

Pete Warden, a former Apple engineer, reluctantly deleted the data after Facebook threatened legal action, saying he could not afford to fight a lawsuit. He said Facebook was not aware that such information was available and that the flaw is being patched.

His handiwork included a “social graph” and a colorful “visualization” that revealed connections among all FB users, which _New Scientist_ writes “would have been a powerful research tool for social scientists and others interested in how people interact.” That raised [privacy concerns](http://www.privacydigest.com/2010/02/13/why%20pete%20warden%20should%20not%20release%20profile%20data%20215%20million%20facebook%20users).

His [map](http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/dn18721/dn18721-3_300.jpg) divides the Facebook nation into regions with such fanciful names as “Stayathomia,” “Greater Texas,” “Socialstan,” “Mormonia,” “Nomadic West,” “Pacifica” and “Dixie.” Read about [the characteristics of each region](http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/02/how-to-split-up-the-us.html).

Here's some of [what he wrote](http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/03/facebook-data-destruction.html) in explaining his decision to wipe the database:

> Despite the bad taste left in my mouth by the legal pressure, I actually have some sympathy for Facebook. I put them on the spot by planning to release data they weren't aware was available&#8230;  
> So what's the good news? From my conversations with technical folks at Facebook, there seems to be a real commitment to figuring out safeguards around the widespread availability of this data. They have a lot of interest in helping researchers find ways of doing worthwhile work without exposing private information.

Separately, Warden writes about “[the unknown marketing databases that know everything about you](http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/03/the-unknown-marketing-databases-that-know-everything-about-you.html)” — and that are for sale to anyone.
