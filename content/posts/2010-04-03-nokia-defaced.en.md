I’m almost certain this shouldn’t be on the Nokia.de webspace, lurking under the “online.nokia.de” subdomain:

Don’t worry though, Admin – they “just changed your index”.

This isn’t the first time Nokia domains have <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/135988/nokia_website_hacked_by_drjr7.html&#038;cid=0" target="_blank">come under attack</a>. The above defacement – by an Albanian hacker called “Spammer” – seems eager to let the webmaster know they can help with the bugs, but I’m pretty sure an email would have been just as useful. Nokia.de have been notified of the defacement, but I’ve had no word back as of yet.
