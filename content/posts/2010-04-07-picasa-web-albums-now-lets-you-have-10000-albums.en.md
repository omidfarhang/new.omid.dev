Here’s a nice little update for Picasa Web Albums users – Google has <a href="http://googlephotos.blogspot.com/2010/04/ten-times-more-albums.html" target="_blank">upped the previous limit</a> of 1,000 albums per account to 10,000. When it comes to storage space for your photos, it’s the same (7.76 GB, shared between Gmail, Google Docs, and Picasa Web Albums), but you can still buy more at <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/PurchaseStorage" target="_blank">very affordable prices</a>.

The default view, however, still only shows a hundred albums. If you have more and want to see the rest, click on either “show more albums” or “show all albums” at the bottom of your page.
