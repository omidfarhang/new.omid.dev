As expected, Microsoft has pushed out a mandatory update to the Xbox 360 today, which adds support for USB storage devices, expanding the memory capacity of the five-year old video game console.

The update will ostensibly allow any FAT32-formatted USB storage device between 1GB-16GB in size to be used to save profiles, game saves, and downloadable content. There are, however, a number of caveats, which mean users can't just plug anything in and have it work.

When the update was first announced, Larry &#8220;Major Nelson&#8221; Hryb said &#8220;Since performance on flash based USB storage is usually better, I <u><i>highly</i></u> recommend using flash based instead of spinning media like a hard driveâ€¦it's just going to give you a <u><i>MUCH</i></u> better experience.&#8221;

Microsoft has minimum performance recommendations for USB storage devices, and if the one you plug in does not meet them, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981975" target="_blank">you will be warned</a>. So far, it looks like Microsoft is using this update to highlight the partnership with SanDisk on the <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/products/gaming-cards/sandisk-xbox-360-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank">branded Xbox 360 USB memory stick</a>, which comes pre-configured with the software update on board, and includes a one month Gold subscription to Xbox Live.
