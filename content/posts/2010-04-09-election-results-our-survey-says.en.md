…”click here to view”.

Yes, it seems almost anything is a target for money generating survey spam.

In this case, we start with a Youtube video:

And we finish with this:

Even better, these “fill in a survey to see the content” websites now pop up an additional message as you try to leave the page:

_“Help keep this content free.  Please take one minute to complete a SPAM-free market research survey to gain access to this special content.”_

Free? They’re preventing the end-user from reading the content unless they sign away their personal information to third party advertisers, while generating affiliate revenue for the owner of the webpage.

I suppose we should be thankful the Youtube link just took us to a spam site, instead of some sort of Malware install…
