Next week, FarmVille players will have the ability to grow peanuts, thanks to ad agency [Saatchi and Saatchi](http://www.saatchi.com/) and an Israeli candy brand.

We’re told this is the first time a FarmVille crop has been directly linked to a brand. Saatchi Interactive in Tel Aviv is working on a rollout campaign for Elite Taami Nutz, a peanut-filled variant of a popular Israeli chocolate bar.

The new crop will roll out with a simultaneous farm design competition on April 14. The peanuts cost 20 credits to buy, sell for 78 credits and can be harvested in 16 hours.

Given the fact that FarmVille has 82 million users worldwide, do you think it’s wise to run an ad campaign for a regional product on this platform? Or has Saatchi Interactive — forgive the pun — gone nuts?
