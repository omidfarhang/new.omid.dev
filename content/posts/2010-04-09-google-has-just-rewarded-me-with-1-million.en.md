I donâ€™t believe it!! This morning Iâ€™ve received an email sent by Google notifying me that IÂ´ve won $950,000,Â  so I think this will be the last post Iâ€™m going to write ðŸ˜‰

Well, I havenâ€™t taken part in any promotion of this kind and Iâ€™ve never heard that Google gives prizes just like that, but I can consider it as if I won the lottery.

Here you have the content of the message:

> Google Incorporations  
> Stamford New Road,  
> Altrincham Cheshire,  
> WA14 1EP  
> London,  
> United Kingdom.  
> We wish to congratulate you once again on this note, for being part of our winners selected this year. This promotion was set-up to encourage the active users of the Google search engine and the Google ancillary services.  
> We wish to formally announce to you that you have successfully passed the requirements, statutory obligations, verifications, validations and satisfactory report Test conducted for all online winners.  
> A winning cheque will be issued in your name by the Google Promotion Award Team, You have therefore won the entire sum of 950,000,00 Â and also a certificate of prize claims will be sent along side your winnings cheque.  
> Google Promotion Award Team

> (5) Occupation/Age.

> Google Incorporations.

And now talking seriously, my reaction to this message shouldnâ€™t have been this, but of skepticism, as itâ€™s a scam.

Email scams are ****designed to defraud users, ****often using the lure of large windfalls or lottery wins but which require a sum of money to be paid in advance.

The message notifies you that youâ€™ve been rewarded with a $1 million prize thanks to a Google promotion to encourage users to use their services.

In order to receive the prize, you have to provide several personal data, like full name, telephone number and nationality, among others.

If youâ€™re victim of the cheat and contact them, the problem is not only that youâ€™re giving them personal information but also that probably in the next email youâ€™re required to send them a certain sum of money, around $1,000, as a commission for the transference.

In the end, you lose your money and they came out of it better off.

Those messages promising you godsend money or the perfect job are **NEVER** trustworthy.
