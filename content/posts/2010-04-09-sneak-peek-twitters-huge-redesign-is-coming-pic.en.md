Now we know for certain: Twitter is working on a major redesign of its web interface. Twitter’s lead designer has just revealed a taste of what’s to come.

<a href="http://twitter.com/stop" target="_blank">Doug Bowman</a>, the head of Twitter’s design team, posted a <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/14379-Profile" target="_blank">teaser picture</a> displaying the new interface. While it doesn’t reveal much, it does show that the profiles are being overhauled, and so are the stats that are displayed on profiles.

As you can see from the image, new stats displayed on profiles include the amount of days you have been on Twitter, the average number of tweets you send per day, and the percentage of @replies recently.

It’s not all that much of a look, but it definitely looks like there will be some big changes coming soon. What do you think of the new design? Let us know in the comments.
