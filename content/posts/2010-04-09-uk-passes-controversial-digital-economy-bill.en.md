[![information-data-tunnel-200](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S7-yFOgPgBI/AAAAAAAAB4o/OjONIoutqTM/information-data-tunnel-260_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800 "information-data-tunnel-200")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S7-x2v1kVQI/AAAAAAAAB4k/Yqb6qYsumdY/s1600-h/information-data-tunnel-260%5B4%5D.jpg) The United Kingdom parliament has passed the Digital Economy Bill, an extensive and controversial piece of legislation, by a vote of 189 to 47. The legislation encompasses online copyright infringement, Internet piracy, regulation of TV and radio, the classification of video games, regulations over ISPs, and a hodgepodge of other digital topics. 

The bill, which you can [read in its entirety here](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2009-10/digitaleconomy.html), is rather complicated and extensive, encompassing over 40 different sections covering online and digital media. Its goal is to clamp down on Internet piracy and illegal file-sharing, although its many critics believe that it is an overreaching piece of legislation. Its potential impact on public Wi-Fi and its harsh penalties for illegal file-sharers [have been hotly debated](http://www.boingboing.net/2009/11/20/britains-new-interne.html). 

The bill [passed](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/communication-breakdown-10000030/mps-approve-digital-economy-bill-voting-189-to-47-10015512/) by a vote of 189 to 47 in a “wash-up” process, which limited the amount of debate MPs took on the bill. 

Until the bill is actually utilized in the real world, it’s tough to tell what its impact will be. [Protests have already begun](http://thenextweb.com/uk/2010/04/08/uks-digital-economy-bill-approved-democracy-fail-social-media-win/) on Twitter though, centered around the [#Debill](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23debill) hashtag.
