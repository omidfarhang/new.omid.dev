Besides the new versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro and Dreamweaver, Adobe Creative Suite 5 also brings Flash Player 10.1 and Adobe AIR® 2, which are “optimized for high performance on mobile screens and designed to take advantage of native device capabilities for a richer, more immersive user experience.” 

Adobe Creative Suite 5 comes in 5 different editions and totals 15 new products; for details check out the [official press release](http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20100411005119&newsLang=en).
