Yesterday evening our spamtraps started receiving the email below in a mass mailing action. The email was immediately flagged as spam even before reaching our spamtraps. No wonder since it has no To:-field, it has a different Reply-to:- than the From:-field and it comes from a DSL line IP address. 

If the user replies to the email, the return address is set to helpdesk_teams@live.com.

Nice try, but the email is just to generic to be actually taken seriously by anyone. I expect to see targeted emails in the next days (as weâ€™ve already seen last year). 

Of course, we advise to never respond to such emails. if you did, [What to do if you've responded to a phishing scam](http://sites.google.com/site/boelectronic/computer/security/phishing/after-phishing).
