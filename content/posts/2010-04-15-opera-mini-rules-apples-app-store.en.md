The fact that Opera Mini was admitted to the App Store was a huge surprise, but judging from the popularity of the app, it was the right move, at least from the users’ point of view. 

At one point, Opera Mini was the most popular free app in all regional App Stores, as you can see in the screenshot below. Right now, the situation has changed slightly, but [Opera Mini is still on top everywhere except in Australia](http://www.apple.com/euro/itunes/charts/apps/top10appstorefree.html), where it holds the second place. 

So yes, the iPhone’s Safari is a great mobile browser, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t interested in alternatives. Check out yesterday’s screenshot below.
