It’s currently the one of the most popular apps in the Apple App Store’s Education category. 

“Buzz Aldrin Portal to Science and Space Exploration” is divided into five sections: Space Buzz, News, Interactive, Buzz Life, and More. We’ve pictured most of them below. 

The Space Buzz section serves up a variety of content (mission data, videos, photos, “buzz’s takes” and more) on nine subjects in space exploration, including Deep Space Exploration, Mysteries & Myths, Mars Exploration, Space Tourism & Private Ventures, Hubble & Other Telescopes, Moon Exploration, International Space Station and International Space Race. 

The news section is simply a series of links to space-related websites like Spacedaily.com, SpacePolitics.com and NASA. The “interactive” tab is a misnomer; there aren’t any games or anything like that, but it does link you to Buzz’s tweets and some interesting articles. 

Buzz Life documents Buzz Aldrin’s life and appearances. You’ll find information about Apollo 11, Gemini 12 and his _[Dancing With the Stars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBduvhKVjmc&feature=PlayList&p=A964FBB977B264C7&playnext_from=PL&index=0&playnext=1)_ appearance there, along with links to his Twitter and YouTube pages and a calendar of his upcoming public appearances. 

The app is available now for $1.99. It works on the iPad and iPod touch as well.
