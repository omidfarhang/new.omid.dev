Taken from Google Official Blog:

[Last year](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html), in our quest to minimize our carbon footprint (and keep people on their toes), we turned to an unlikely solution for mowing an overgrown field: goats. More than 200 goats from [California Grazing](http://www.californiagrazing.com/) have once again arrived at our [Mountain View headquarters](http://maps.google.com/?q=Google%20Inc.@37.423156,-122.084917&hl=en) where they’ll stay for over a week chomping away on grassy goodness. The cost of bringing in the goats is comparable to hiring lawn mowers for the same job and the green benefits are clear: the goats eliminate mower emissions, reduce noise pollution, restore plant species and fertilize while grazing. 

Don’t worry, we’re not going to be in the business of [chèvre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_milk_cheese) anytime soon, but in the meantime we’re having a lot of fun watching our new colleagues.
