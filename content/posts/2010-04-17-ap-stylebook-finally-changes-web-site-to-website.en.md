We’d actually gone rogue on the issue ourselves several months ago, thinking that “[Web site](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/web+site)” was a rather antiquated way for describing “a computer connected to the internet that maintains a series of web pages on the World Wide Web.” 

According to a [tweet](http://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/12296505018) from the AP Stylebook, the change is noted as of today on its web version, and will be included in the next print edition, due out next month. We’re pretty ecstatic about the change, and hold our collective breath for other possible updates, such as changing “e-mail” to “email.”
