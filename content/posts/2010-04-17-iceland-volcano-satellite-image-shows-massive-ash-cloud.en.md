A volcano in Iceland with probably the coolest and most formidable name ever, Eyjafjallajokull, erupted this Wednesday, April 14. As we wrote earlier, European travelers have since been stranded around the world — including the Norwegian prime minister, whose trusty iPad is thankfully keeping his country’s government afloat. 

NASA’s Terra satellite [captured the above image](http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/iceland-volcano-plume.html) depicting the enormous ash cloud migrating from the Eyjafjallajokull Volcano into Northern Europe yesterday. It’s unknown how long it will take the [hazardous cloud](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_iceland_volcano) to disperse, but estimates start at 48 hours — leaving much of Europe grounded in the volcano’s wake. 

For more imagery from the Icelandic eruption, check out this [curated gallery on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yahooeditorspicks/galleries/72157623855495574) from photographers across Europe documenting the volcano’s impact.
