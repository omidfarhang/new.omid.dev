[![iphone_3gs](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S8oebWdNmXI/AAAAAAAACBA/V2ukUJwCnMc/iphone_3gs_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800 "iphone_3gs")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S8oeXec_BjI/AAAAAAAACA8/9zcCmQJOFbE/s1600-h/iphone_3gs%5B4%5D.jpg) We suspected that the iPhone 4.0 would be nothing special compared to previous versions, at least when it comes to jailbreaking the operating system. Now, a [jailbreak tool](http://wikee.iphwn.org/howto:rsbeta) has been [released](http://gizmodo.com/5518414/iphone-40-beta-jailbreak-tool-released-for-iphone-3g) for iPhone 4.0 Beta, and the eternal game of cat and mouse between Apple and the hacking community continues. 

Even if you’ve managed to install the iPhone 4.0 beta software on your iPhone, this jailbreak is not an easy one — just take a look at all of the [warnings](http://wikee.iphwn.org/howto:rsbeta). In short, this jailbreak is aimed at app developers, not the general public. Nevertheless it’s here, meaning that a jailbreak for consumers will probably be ready and waiting when the 4.0 OS comes out of beta.
