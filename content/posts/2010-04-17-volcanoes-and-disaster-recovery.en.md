Dr. Johannes Ullrich at SANS brought up a good point in his morning podcast ([Stormcast 296](http://isc.sans.org/podcast.html) ) about widespread transportation shutdowns and disaster recovery planning.

The Eyjafjallajokull glacier volcano in Iceland, which has stopped all air travel in the UK, Western Europe and Scandinavia, of course is the case in point.

Those writing and updating disaster recovery plans should keep in mind the possibilities of just such widespread transportation shutdowns when they plan for personnel to operate remote (backup) network operations centers. If an enterprise’s plan calls for an IT crew to fly to a backup NOC and they can’t get there, what then?

Good observation.

[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/business/17supply.html?src=busln) quotes Bill McGuire from Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre saying that the last Eyjafjallajokull eruption lasted more than a year. Aon is an insurance broker and risk management consultant.
