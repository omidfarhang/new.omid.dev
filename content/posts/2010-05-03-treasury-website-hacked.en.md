For a short while today a couple of treas.gov websites were hacked, and were reaching out to an attack site in Ukraine. 

The websites involved were bep.gov (Bureau of Engraving and Printing), bep.treas.gov and moneyfactory.gov. They had been script injected with the line of code circled in red&#8230;

Btw, you should \_not\_ mess with the attack site (grepad) &#8230; it was dead earlier today, but could easily come back to life. 

Although it's obviously a bummer that they got hacked in the first place, the admins at treasury actually deserve a big shout-out of praise, because they reacted quite quickly, and fixed the problem. Good job guys! 

Once again, it shows how anyone can get hacked.
