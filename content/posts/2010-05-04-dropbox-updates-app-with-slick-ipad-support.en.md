The iPhone version was already quite good, but Dropbox have now [updated the app](http://www.macstories.net/ipad/dropbox-for-ipad-available/) for better iPad support. 

The new version of the app, available [for free here](http://itunes.apple.com/be/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8) [warning: iTunes link], makes great use of the extra screen real estate afforded by the iPad and takes advantage of both portrait and landscape modes. A few other visual niceties separate the iPad from the iPhone version, making an overall slicker appearance and implementation on the larger device.

Although there aren’t nearly as many options here in terms of actually working with your Dropbox files as in the web-based interface for example, you can both view and share items with friends via email. You can also send supported file types on to other native iPad applications like Pages and Keynote. 

It’s essentially an iPad-optimized version of Dropbox, and considering it’s only the first pass we expect to see more upgrades and functionality coming along presently as well. If you have a chance to check out the app, let us know what you think in the comments.
