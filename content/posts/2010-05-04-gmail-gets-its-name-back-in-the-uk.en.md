These disputes take a long time ([Gmail was changed into Googlemail](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/googlemail.html) in October 19, 2005), so Google opted on using a different (yet recognizable) name until the dispute is resolved. 

Four and a half years later, UK users will finally get their @gmail.com addresses, as [Googlemail is changing back into Gmail](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/google-mail-is-becoming-gmail-in-uk.html). Users will have the possibility of keeping their old @googlemail.com address or switching to a new one. From the announcement: “If you already have a Google email account in the UK, you’ll soon have the option to switch your existing @googlemail.com address to the matching @gmail.com one, but you’re also free to stick with @googlemail.com. And starting later this week, anybody who signs up for a new account in the UK will get an @gmail.com address.” 

Google jokingly estimates that the change will have a positive impact on the overall energy consumption. “Since “gmail” is 50% fewer characters than “googlemail,” we estimate this name change will save approximately 60 million keystrokes a day. At about 217 microjoules per keystroke, that’s about the energy of 20 bonbons saved every day,” it claims. 

The transition from Googlemail to Gmail will happen over the next week.
