[![ipad_microwave](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S-AMZvn--QI/AAAAAAAACFg/T9EWQ58Z-Kg/ipad_microwave_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800 "ipad_microwave")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S-AMXz_qCrI/AAAAAAAACFc/H46WhlCo59U/s1600-h/ipad_microwave%5B3%5D.jpg) Poor iPad. It’s only been on the market for a month, and it’s already been crashed to bits with a baseball bat, blended and generally abused in every possible way. 

In hopefully the last act of agression against this beautiful piece of technology, the iPad has now also been microwaved. As always, it’s not hard to guess what the outcome is, but you just have to see the inevitable result. 

The video is inexplicably long, so we recommend you skip to 3:30 for the actual microwaving, and 6:30 for the really interesting bits.
