The startup has just surpassed three million users, which means the company has attracted over one million new users in four months and that growth is rapidly accelerating. 

Evernote is now registering 8,000 new users per day — no doubt with the help of its fantastic iPad app. The company also points to international interest as well as partner referrals as drivers of growth. 

Also significant is that Evernote is able to successfully convert free users to paid users. The service currently boasts upwards of 59,000 premium subscribers. At $5 per month per premium user, Evernote is making approximately $295,000 a month, or $3.5 million a year. 

If you’re unfamiliar with Evernote, the service supports audio, image and text notes that sync across desktop, web and mobile platforms. It’s also known for its impressive search capabilities, which includes text searching within photos. To date the company has raised more than $25 million in funding, with the most recent round going to ramp up product — an effort that appears to be paying off handsomely.
