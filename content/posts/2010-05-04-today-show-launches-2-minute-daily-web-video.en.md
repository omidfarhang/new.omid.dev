The show will feature host Natalie Morales and will include two minutes of _Today_ content, including weather, news headlines and other stories. Each segment will appear on [TODAYshow.com](http://todayshow.com/) and [MSN.com](http://msn.com/) at 6:30 a.m. ET every weekday. The spots will initially be sponsored by Buick. 

“In 2009, TODAYshow.com had more video streams than the combined total for all of ABC News and CBS News sites,” said _Today_ Executive Producer Jim Bell in a statement released today. “TODAY in 2 Minutes is for people who can’t wait until 7 a.m. to quickly get the news of the day from a place they know and trust.” 

“TODAY in 2 Minutes” rounds out other online offerings from _Today_, including a [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/todayshow) and [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/todayshow). We’re uncertain if these spots will be hosted on YouTube or another sharing-friendly video site, or if they’ll be siloed on the _Today_ and MSN websites. 

What do you think of _The Today Show_’s new online component? Is this the best way for a mainstream television show to incorporate online video?
