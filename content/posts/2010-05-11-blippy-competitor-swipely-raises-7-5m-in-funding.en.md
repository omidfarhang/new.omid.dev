a [Blippy](http://blippy.com/) competitor, has just announced a $7.5 million series A round of funding from First Round Capital, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures and several angel investors, including Ron Conway and Chris Sacca. This news comes hot on the heels of Blippy’s $11.2 million Series A just a couple weeks ago. Danny Rimer of Index Ventures will join Swipely’s board of directors, and Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners will serve as an observer on Swipely’s board. In December and November of last year, the company raised $1 million in angel funding from First Round and others. Currently, Swipely is in invitation-only beta. While certain Swipely investors have noted that this service “gets it right” — presumably compared to Blippy and similar apps — we’re uncertain which services inspire such confidence. It could be that Swipely offers more granular choices when it comes to sharing credit card and in-store or online purchases; indeed, privacy is a major concern for those who would consider sharing purchasing information with their social graph. Security of user data is another feature/benefit touted by Swipely — an interesting claim to make following the exposure of Blippy users’ credit card numbers in Google search results last month. Here’s an overview of Swipely’s service: Do you think $7.5 million is enough to catapult a private beta app into a leading position in this still-nascent category? Or is there room for two apps in the space of purchase sharing? Let us know your opinion in the comments.
