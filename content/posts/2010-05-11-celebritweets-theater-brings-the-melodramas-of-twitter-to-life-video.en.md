Enter, “[Celebritweets Theater](http://wonderwall.msn.com/movies/Tweets-Theater-97.videos).” 

We’re already fans of Odessa Begay’s inspired “Museum of Modern Tweets,” in which the artist composes surrealistic pictures of the strange things famous people say. “Celebritweets Theater” is basically a horse of the same color — short cartoons that tell the story behind the tweet. A dude that goes by [“KCS Cougar”](http://twitter.com/kcscougar) draws these cartoons for celebrity news site [Wonderwall](http://wonderwall.msn.com/), and they have a rather Dr. Katz-esque vibe. I’ve embedded my favorite — which mocks Lady Gaga — below.
