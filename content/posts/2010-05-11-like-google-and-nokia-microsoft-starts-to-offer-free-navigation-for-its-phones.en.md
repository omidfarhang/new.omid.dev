[Today Microsoft announced that it is following suit](http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2010/05/10/updated-bing-app-for-windows-phone.aspx) with free turn-by-turn navigation for Windows 6.x and up phones, powered by Bing Maps. 

When getting directions with Bing, there will now be a “Navigate” button which starts the turn-by-turn voice navigation. The voice navigation feature was developed by the [Microsoft Tellme team](http://www.tellme.com/). 

Phones initially compatible with the new free navigation service include: HTC Fuze, HTC Pure, HTC HD2, HTC Tilt 2, HTC Touch Diamond 2, HTC Touch HD, HTC Touch Pro, HTC Touch Pro 2, Motorola Q9c, Samsung Jack, Samsung Omnia II, Samsung Propel, and T-Mobile Dash 3G.
