Now, Project Natal was all but confirmed for October launch by Microsoft Saudi marketing manager Syed Bilal Tariq in an interview with [GamertagRadio](http://www.gamertagradio.com/cmps_index.php). “It is going to be somewhere in October. We will be in a position to confirm the date at E3, which is in June, but definitely it is going to be October 2010,” he said. 

Love it or hate it, Microsoft has done some great things for gaming, and they might be on the verge of launching another game-changing (pun intended) technology. The jury on the official name is still out, though; any guesses to what it might be?
