Unfortunately, his answers rarely contain more than a few words. Macrumors reports that a reader asked Steve Jobs via e-mail [why the iPad cannot print documents](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/10/steve-jobs-says-printing-will-come-for-ipad/). Steve’s answer? “It will come.” 

Even if we disregard the possibility that the e-mail may be fake, Steve’s answer gives us very little to be happy about as we have no idea _when_ printing to the iPad will come. Will it come this summer? When the next version arrives? Sometime in the next decade? We’re optimists, so we’ll just pretend that Steve meant “soon.”
