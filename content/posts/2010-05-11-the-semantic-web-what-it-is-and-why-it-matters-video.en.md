The Internet currently holds about as much information as 1,700 Libraries of Congress. Some of the leading minds on the web are exploring new ways to sort this data and how to understand not just what data is about, but also how data is linked. 

For example, a picture on Flickr is more than just a number of pixels and a file size. It was uploaded by a person and might contain images of other people. It might have been taken in a specific place or be about a specific moment in time. Those bits of information link that photograph to other entities: people, places, things and events. When we know how data is linked and we use that information to determine relevancy across media and sources, we’re using the semantic web. 

Simply put, the semantic web gives us more than just raw data; it shows us the context and relationships behind and between those data. 

Student [Kate Ray](http://kateray.net/film/) interviewed a flock of researchers, entrepreneurs and other innovators for her 14-minute documentary, _Web 3.0_. Ray is a journalism/psych major at NYU who has done extensive [research](http://web2point5.wordpress.com/) on the semantic web. Her subjects include World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, [Hunch.com](http://www.hunch.com/) CEO and inventor Chris Dixon, and a host of other semantic web experts. 

Ray’s film is a brief but high-level discussion of semantic technologies, the tech that’s going to affect how we use the Internet and all its information for years to come. If you’ve ever wanted to know more about the semantic web, what it is and why it matters to all kinds of Internet users, we highly recommend checking out this documentary below.
