Russian-based PROXIEZ-NET, which was known to allegedly host 13 Zbot command-and-control servers has been shut down by its upstream provider DIGERNET, according to the site The New New Internet (News story on Web Host Review here: [“Alleged Russian Malware Host Cut Off By Upstream Provider”](http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/051710_Alleged_Russian_Malware_Host_Cut_Off_By_Upstream_Provider))

Legitimate web sites hosted by PROXIEZ-NET many have been caught in the takedown, the Review said.  
[Brick House Security](http://blog.brickhousesecurity.com/2010/05/17/spy-keylogger/) said the Zbot-related servers on PROXIEZ-NET were used to collect PayPal, EBay and online banking passwords stolen by key logging malware.

There's probably an interesting story behind WHY an upstream provider took down a (formerly) bullet-proof ISP that hosted criminal activity IN RUSSIA. I doubt if it will ever be made public though.
