Yesterday, we got to take a look at Qik's mobile video chat client for the Sprint EVO 4G, and today, we get to take a look at Skype's latest development: five-way video chat. 

Today, popular VoIP and chat client Skype [launched a beta of Skype 5.0 for Windows](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/beta/), which includes a free trial of group video calling, a re-designed call view window, improved video snapshots gallery, and improved browser plugin performance. 

There are a few fixes introduced with this version, but also a whole host of new bugs to deal with. [The release notes for version 5.0.0.105](http://blogs.skype.com/garage/2010/05/skype_50_beta_1_for_windows.html) include a list of 87 known issues, most of which do not have workarounds yet. 

We're installing the beta now, and we'll post screenshots and a review shortly.
