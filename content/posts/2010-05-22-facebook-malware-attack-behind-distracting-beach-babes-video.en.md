A Facebook malware attack is on the loose this weekend, enticing users to click a “Distracting Beach Babes” video on their Facebook Walls. The Wall message reads: 

> “this is hilarious! lol 😛 😛 😛 Distracting Beach Babes [HQ] Length: 5:32″.

**If you see this video on Facebook today, do not click the link:** Doing so, and downloading a linked file, will result in malware being installed on your computer.

If you see the video on your wall, remove it. If you’ve clicked the video, meanwhile, run a [virus and adware scan](/knowledge-base/malware-removal/) on your computer. And of course, be more careful about clicking suspicious-looking links in future.
