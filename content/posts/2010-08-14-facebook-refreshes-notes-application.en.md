Today the social network has rolled out a refreshed version of Notes to remedy the problem. 

The Facebook Notes application has been overhauled with a new look and feel that includes an easier-to-use left-hand menu and a few notable new features. 

The most significant update to Notes is the addition of a text editor that includes standard formatting options that let Facebook users click to bold, italicize, underline, indent quotes and add bullet or numbered lists to their notes. Facebook Notes also now lets users tag Facebook Pages in their notes and more easily locate saved drafts. 

The updates to Notes should make the application much more user-friendly and encourage more on-site note creation.
