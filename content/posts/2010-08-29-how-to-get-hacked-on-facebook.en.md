One of the most common scenarios we observe on a daily basis are users coaxed into phishing campaigns and malicious applications on Facebook.  As we interact with our friends and family on social networks, we tend to trust of any and all of the information that appears to be from our “trusted network.”  However, Facebook is one of the most trolled social networks by cyber criminals.  They are waiting for you to make a mistake and once you make it, they will be sure to hack you and exploit your friends trust through your newly hacked account.

In this post, we’ll take you through the steps of how a profile on Facebook becomes hacked. Obviously, we don’t want you to follow these steps, but we hope that by arming you with this knowledge, you’ll be one step ahead in thwarting evildoers on social networks.

**Step 1:  The hook**

The hook always starts off with a friends hacked profile.  You’ll get a message (appearing to be from them) stating that you need to click on a link for something.  In most cases, it’s a “SHOCKING VIDEO” or “We caught you on tape” and the message will usually address you by your first name.

Here is an example:

**Step 2: Phishing Attempt**

Now that the cyber criminals have lured you in, they’ll need your user name and password to start the next stage of the attack.  The application link you clicked on will appear to look exactly like the Facebook login site, but if you look carefully you’ll see that you are not visiting Facebook.com, but rather a malicious copy located at another website address.

Example:

[<img title="ScreenHunter_14-Aug.-27-12.54" border="0" alt="ScreenHunter_14-Aug.-27-12.54" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpeY3Z6DcI/AAAAAAAACaE/E4mTQAn9N8Q/ScreenHunter_14-Aug.-27-12.54_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="644" height="441" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpeVKNrJ2I/AAAAAAAACaA/IUgT6AdAWlk/s1600-h/ScreenHunter_14-Aug.-27-12.54%5B5%5D.jpg)

**Step 3: Gaining Full Access**

Now that you’ve clicked on the link and given them your credentials, they will also request that you give their malicious application full access to the personal information and various rights to post information via your profile.  This ensures that they will be able to spread this attack out to all of your friends and family once they are through with you.

[<img title="ScreenHunter_15-Aug.-27-12.55" border="0" alt="ScreenHunter_15-Aug.-27-12.55" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpeiN5wq4I/AAAAAAAACaM/b-liPzqqOgg/ScreenHunter_15-Aug.-27-12.55_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="644" height="456" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpedWLWCDI/AAAAAAAACaI/k4dHT_s8pTU/s1600-h/ScreenHunter_15-Aug.-27-12.55%5B4%5D.jpg)

After you give the malicious application permission, the attack will now start targeting your friends.

In this example, we see a few of the victims friends falling for the trick:

So there you have it.  Hook, line, and sinker. We hope that you take this information and share it with all of your friends so they know what to do in the event of a similar attack on their profile.
