Like a lot of seedy stuff, this started with a Twitter post:.

[<img title="Firefox_20crack_twitter" border="0" alt="Firefox_20crack_twitter" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpjnyG5wSI/AAAAAAAACa0/HkZudITn_IU/Firefox_20crack_twitter_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="493" height="80" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpjlpHnDII/AAAAAAAACaw/MHoXc6K7FoI/s1600-h/Firefox_20crack_twitter%5B3%5D.png)

The current working version of Mozilla’s Firefox browser is 3.6.8. Version 4 is in beta testing. You get them FREE from Mozilla..

Why would you need a crack (program with its password broken) or a keygen (application that generates a password for a password-protected program) for something that is FREE?

Well, there’s a sucker born every minute and the folks at this warez (pirated software) site are betting there are a lot of them using Twitter.

Anybody who was unwise enough to bite on this, (if they were running a trusted Antivirus) would see this when they hit the download button for the crack or the keygen:

[<img title="FF_20Crack" border="0" alt="FF_20Crack" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpj5MihVhI/AAAAAAAACbE/NWhQeTb6XHY/FF_20Crack_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="372" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/THpjy81wW-I/AAAAAAAACbA/5khLou2CjSE/s1600-h/FF_20Crack%5B3%5D.png)

The crack and keygen were infected with a Trojan downloader VirTool.Win32.Obfuscator.hg!b (v). That’s the Sunbelt detection for an old standard commonly known as “2GCash-FakeCrackSerial.”

Clicking the button to downloading Firefox 4.0 takes the potential victim to another site:

That one offers a whole nest of things to download that are infected with:

FraudTool.Win32.FakeVimes  
Trojan-Downloader.Win32.CodecPack.2GCash.Gen  
Trojan.DNSChanger.Gen  
Virus.Win32.Parite  
TrojanDownloader-Win32/FakeRean
