It fixes 10 security vulnerabilities; 1 is only affecting Mac OS X and critical, 6 are rated “high” in their severity. As usual, the update should get delivered and installed automatically – but it doesn’t hurt to check via the “Info about Chrome” option in the “settings” menu whether  the new version is already installed.

Now [Firefox 3.6.10](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6.10/releasenotes/) is available which fixes the security vulnerabilities like 3.6.9 and also the instabilities. It is available via “Help” – “Check for Updates” and should be installed ASAP, too.
