Conversation view has been a characteristic of Gmail ever since it launched, but Google software engineer Dong Chen admitted in a [blog post](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/09/threaded-email-or-not-now-its-your.html) yesterday that it is the webmail service's &#8220;most hotly debated feature &#8220;.

&#8220;Threading enthusiasts say they spend less mental energy drawing connections between related messages, and that their inboxes are much less cluttered,&#8221; he wrote.

&#8220;On the other hand, email traditionalists, like many former Outlook users, think conversation view just complicates something that has worked for years.&#8221;

Users who prefer traditionally displayed emails will soon be able to toggle off conversation view and see their emails in chronological order, according to Chen.

&#8220;We really hoped everyone would learn to love conversation view, but we came to realize that it's just not right for some people,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Over the next few days, we'll be rolling out conversation view settings to users in organizations with the &#8216;Enable pre-release features' option selected in the Google Apps control panel, and to individuals using Gmail.&#8221;
