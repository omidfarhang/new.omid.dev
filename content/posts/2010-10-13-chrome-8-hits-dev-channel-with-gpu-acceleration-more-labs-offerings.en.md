If you're using the Dev channel, open up a tab and type in `about:labs`. You'll notice features there to turn off outdated plug-ins, enable &#8220;Remoting&#8221; support for Chrome, turn on the very useful Google Instant in the Chrome Omnibar, and enable a few other useful features, including GPU acceleration of the HTML5 Canvas feature.

In the settings, you'll find a spot to sign in and manage your &#8220;Cloud Print&#8221; settings. It's the print-from-anywhere feature that Google has claimed as its solution to the Chrome OS &#8220;printing problem,&#8221; and it looks intriguingâ€”even if you can't actually do anything from your web settings panel yet:
