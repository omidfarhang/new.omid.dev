Welcome to our first release of the new Mozilla [about:support](https://mozillalabs.com/messaging/aboutsupport/) add-on.

about:support was developed by Siddharth Agarwal with design input from Bryan Clark and testing by Roland Tanglao

about:support is based on Firefoxâ€™s about:support code, hence the name. It has been modified for Thunderbird to include email account specific information along with the normal preferences and add-ons.

<img title="about-support-300x198" border="0" alt="about-support-300x198" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TLoL-K2aBqI/AAAAAAAACq0/Slq571RzOVs/about-support-300x198%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="300" height="198" /> 

You can access about:support from the Help Menu: <tt>Help</tt> -> <tt>Troubleshooting Information</tt> which opens a new tab containing all your troubleshooting information including the Thunderbird specific IMAP, POP, and SMTP settings. The account information is often difficult for users to gather and deliver during the Thunderbird troubleshooting process. With the about:support add-on, the troubleshooting information is presented to the user such that it can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into a Thunderbird support forum like Get Satisfaction or emailed directly to others.</p> 

With your help, Mozilla is hoping to get this add-on built directly into future versions of Thunderbird so please try it out and leave your feedback. See the [about:support](https://mozillalabs.com/messaging/aboutsupport/) project page for links concerning issues, feedback, and ideas.
