Firefox's JavaScript engine, Spidermonkey (including the Tracemonkey and Jaegermonkey JITs) is now faster than Webkit's JSCore on both Sunspider and V8. [Great work, team!](http://www.arewefastyet.com/)

Also, on the Sunspider benchmark, Mozilla is only about 1/100th of a second behind Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine (about 3.5%). Oh, and there's [Kraken, where we're still solidly in the lead](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2010/09/javascript_performan.html).
