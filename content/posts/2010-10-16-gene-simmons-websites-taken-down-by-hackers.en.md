Some people didn't like his comments about downloading…

Two of Gene Simmons' official sites were [shut down](http://www.nme.com/news/kiss/53432) after hacker attacks by a group called Anonymous, associated with the 4chan.org forum. The attacks were in response to comments by Simmons about how the music industry should have been tougher with illegal downloaders.

Both SimmonsRecords.com and GeneSimmons.com were taken offline briefly due to the attacks.

> Simmons had made the comment, _“The music industry was asleep at the wheel, and didn't have the balls to sue every fresh-faced, freckle-faced college kid who downloaded material. And so now we're left with hundreds of thousands of people without jobs. There's no industry.”_
