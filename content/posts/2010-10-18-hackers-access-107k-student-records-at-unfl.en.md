The good news is that overseas hackers apparently did not change the grades of more then 100 thousand University of North Florida students when they broke into the computer system in September.

The bad news is that personal information like names and social security numbers for those students may now be in the hands of those hackers.

The FBI is investigating the attack, which was discovered by the university in a routine check of the server.  
According to University officials, the hacker had access to the system between September 24th and September 29th, but the University did not say when the breach was discovered. The Florida Times-Union newspaper said the university learned of the attack in September but did not notify potential victims because they were still investigating

In a statement, the University said no academic records or financial information was taken, but information like names and social security numbers are prime fodder for identity thieves.
