Google just took a jab at Microsoft. Oh, the search giant already did that last week, and it wasn't the first time? Yes, you're right, but now it's Google CEO Eric Schmidt targeting the software giant's biggest product, the latest version of which is particularly successful. Schmidt recently made comments about Windows 7 during a question and answer session at the 25th anniversary celebration of MIT's legendary Media Lab. 

In a wide-ranging discussion with National Public Radio journalist John Hockenberry, Schmidt proclaimed that the goal of great technology is to get people to use computers less so they can be more productive. That's fine, but he didn't stop there. “The hours I spend reprogramming my PC in Windows 7 is not a very good use of my time,” he told students in the MIT Media Lab auditorium according to [CRN](http://www.crn.com/news/cloud/227900083/google-ceo-trashes-windows-7-and-the-washington-establishment.htm). “Why I choose to do that in the first place is a problem with judgment,” he added.

We should expect more and more comments like this one from Google as the company readies its answer to Windows, dubbed Chrome OS. Schmidt has already talked about the OS before but now it's clear he's getting ready to start trash talking the competition as well. Chrome OS is slated to arrive before the end of the year. Just last week there was reason to believe that it was at the Release Candidate phase.
