The high-definition sets, which were unveiled in New York, will have LCD screens ranging from 24 inches to 46 inches and a remote control system that comes with the standard QWERTY keyboard to enter search requests, send emails or make comments on the Web whilst simultaneously whilst watching television.

Furthermore, consumers will be able to search for their favorite television programs and Websites on the same screen, at the same time. This means that Google TV will make it possible for consumers to search the Web, access Facebook and watch films on YouTube in the comfort of their sitting rooms. Twitter and a number of music sites such as Napster, Pandora and Vevo, have also designed features for the system.

The new TVs will be built on Googleâ€™s Android operating system, use Intel Atom processor and navigate the Web via the Google Chrome browser. As the Internet television sets go on sale this month, it will be interesting to see how successful they will eventually become in the increasingly competitive market if the price is right.
