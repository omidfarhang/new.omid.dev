These releases make several improvements to Thunderbird’s performance, stability, and security. There are also several fixes to improve the user interface and add-ons experience.

  * Thunderbird 3.1.5: <http://getthunderbird.com/> 
  * Thunderbird 3.0.9: <http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/all-older.html> 

We strongly recommend that all Thunderbird users upgrade to these releases. If you already have Thunderbird 3.1 or 3.0, you will receive an automated update notification within 24 to 48 hours. You can also manually fetch this update by selecting “Check for Updates…” from the Help menu.
