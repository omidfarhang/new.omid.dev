My favorite music player in old days ‘Winamp’ has now [released](http://blog.winamp.com/2010/10/20/winamp-for-android-now-in-beta/) its official app (currently in Beta) for Android devices. The app is available as a free download to everyone.

**Winamp** media player is a nice app for Android. It offers a complete media management solution by seamlessly syncing with the Winamp desktop library. In addition to high quality playback and persistent player controls, Winamp for Android offers wireless desktop sync with your Winamp desktop application.
