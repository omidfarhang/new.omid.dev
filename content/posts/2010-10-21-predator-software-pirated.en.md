> _Intelligent Integration Systems (IISi), a small Boston-based software development firm, alleges that their Geospatial Toolkit and Extended SQL Toolkit were pirated by Massachusetts-based Netezza for use by a government client. Subsequent evidence and court proceedings revealed that the &#8220;government client&#8221; seeking assistance with Predator drones was none other than the Central Intelligence Agency._ 
> 
> _IISi is seeking an injunction that would halt the use of their two toolkits by Netezza for three years. Most importantly, IISi alleges in court papers that Netezza used a &#8220;hack&#8221; version of their software with incomplete targeting functionality in response to rushed CIA deadlines. As a result, Predator drones could be missing their targets by as much as 40 feet._

The obvious joke is that this is what you get when you go with the low bidder, but it doesn't have to be that way. And there's nothing special about this being a government procurement; any bespoke IT procurement needs good contractual oversight.
