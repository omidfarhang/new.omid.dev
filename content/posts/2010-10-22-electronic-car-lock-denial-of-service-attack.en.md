A quick search of the internet shows that devices offering to jam car locks are easily available for around $100. Effectiveness at up to 100m is claimed._

I thought car door locks weren't much of a deterrent to a professional car thief.

The thieves are not stealing cars, they're stealing things left inside the cars.
