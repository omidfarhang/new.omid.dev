Google News continues to integrate with Twitter and other micro blogging services. After testing a section that shows [newsworthy tweets from your subscription](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/10/google-news-tests-twitter-sidebar.html), Google started to add to the Google News Onebox the number of times a story has been shared.

For example, Google's Onebox shows that [this article about Google TV](http://phandroid.com/2010/10/17/google-tv-in-stock-at-best-buy-check-out-their-in-store-product-guide/) has been shared by more than 50 Twitter users. Google links to [the real-time results](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&tbs=mbl:1&q=link:http://phandroid.com/2010/10/17/google-tv-in-stock-at-best-buy-check-out-their-in-store-product-guide/) for this article, but the page only includes 10 results.
