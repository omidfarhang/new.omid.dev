Lady Gaga took to Twitter this morning to announce that her YouTube videos have hit the lofty milestone of 1 billion total views. The musician is the first to reach such a goal, but Justin Bieber is trailing close behind with 962,726,797 total video views.

Sources were predicting this outcome a few weeks ago, with [Lady Gaga](http://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/28591002272) reaching 1 billion [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/ladygagaofficial?blend=1&ob=4) views around October 20, and Bieber hitting the mark on November 1.

Nevertheless, Bieber continues to hold court as the King of YouTube with the most-viewed video of all time — his song “Baby” has 365,428,461 views.

My Personal Note: I’m not a fan of Lady Gaga or Justin Beiber, I Highly Dislike both of them!
