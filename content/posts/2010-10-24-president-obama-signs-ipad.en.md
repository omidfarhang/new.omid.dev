Sylvester Caan dropped us a note to tell us (and show us!) his iPad being signed by US President Barak Obama. Take it away, Sylvester:

> At a rally in Seattle, WA at the University of Washington, the President used the touchscreen on my iPad to give me his autograph.
> 
> He looked slightly surprised, but proceeded to use his finger to scribble on the iPad using the Adobe Ideas app.

How well was he able to sign? Check out the results and the video after the break. And if you and your iPhone or iPad have had any brushes with power or celebrity, let us know in the comments!
