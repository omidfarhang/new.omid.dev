Well in time for the [MeeGo Conference](http://conference2010.meego.com/) next month, Nokia has just started the rollout of the all new PR 1.3 firmware (v20.2010.36-2) for the N900. The update is available over the air (OTA) in the UK with other countries expected to follow suit tomorrow. It should also be available via Nokia’s Software Updater in the coming days, but if you can’t wait or want to flash your device to get a fresh start, [grab the firmware images from here](http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/nokia_N900.php) and get cracking.

Simply grab the vanilla version for PR 1.3 for your region and get flashing [using this guide](http://maemo.org/news/2010/02/05/how-to-hard-reset-the-n900-to-the-factory-state/). If you are on a Mac, [this is the guide to follow](http://maemo.org/news/2010/05/25/how-flash-the-n900-firmware-on-a-mac/). The new firmware brings bug fixes, stability improvements and support for Nokia’s Ovi Suite. This firmware is also supposed to aid developers (& power users?) in dual booting their devices into MeeGo and I suspect this would be the main draw come November and the MeeGo Conference.
