The RSS feed service has received an experimental new interface that better matches Google Analytics and looks like it might actually integrate into other Google AdSense and Webmaster tools. 

The interface doesn’t work for every component of Feedburner — if you need to access feed management or change certain settings, you can continue to use the old interface. The new interface — which is accessible via [feedburner.google.com/gfb/](http://feedburner.google.com/gfb/) — shows real-time stats for clicks, views and podcast downloads from across your feeds.  
This is really powerful, especially if you use the Feedburner Socialize service to auto-ping Twitter when you publish a post. This can let you track how users are referred and what RSS clients are being used to access feeds.

The stats take a lot of the information that used to be spread across multiple panels and put it into one interface. You can also view the last two hours of activity for a feed to see different waves of traffic and click-throughs.

The new Feedburner dashboard also has a new message center that displays notices if there are any problems with a feed or other things that you need to know.

We hope these [new real-time tools](http://adsenseforfeeds.blogspot.com/2010/10/your-stats-right-away.html) and the improved interface are the start of some real momentum behind the Feedburner product. RSS might be going out of favor in a world of Facebook, Twitter and mobile apps, but publishers still need a central place to control and manage their content streams. Feedburner no longer does everything publishers need it to do, but there just aren’t a lot of alternatives.

What do you think of the new Feedburner interface? Let us know.
