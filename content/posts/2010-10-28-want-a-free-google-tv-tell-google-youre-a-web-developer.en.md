[Google](http://googletv.blogspot.com/2010/10/google-tv-is-coming-to-10000-lucky.html) knows it's going to have a tough time convincing users to switch to its TV platform. As a result, over the next few weeks, the search giant is handing out 10,000 free Google TV units to developers in hopes of “empowering the developers of the world to make Google TV an even better experience, through websites that have been built with the TV screen in mind.” 3,000 Google TV devices (specifically, Logitech Revues) were already given away to attendees of the Adobe MAX conference. 

The remaining devices will go to existing Web developers in the Google Code community, but the company is also accepting entries from professional Web developers into the [Google TV Web Developer Promotion](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googletvgiveaway/). You'll need to include a short summary about the type of interesting website your company would like to create or optimize for Google TV. Google is planning to select 2,500 winners from those entries.

For those outside of US borders: “this giveaway is only for U.S based developers,” Google said. “We hope to make Google TV available in other markets soon.
