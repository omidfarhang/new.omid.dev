While the service pack, which is shared between Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, comprises a collection of all the latest bug fixes and security patches to have been released since the launch of the operating system, Microsoft's Brandon LeBlanc has confirmed that Windows 7 users won't be getting any new features if they choose to install the update.

While Windows Server 2008 R2 users will enjoy the addition of two new virtualization-related technologies, Dynamic Memory and RemoteFX, to their operating system, Windows 7 users will have to be content with the knowledge that they are running the very latest patches on their system.

Dynamic Memory is an improvement to Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization hypervisor which, the company claims, increases the software's memory usage efficiency, allowing physical memory to be rapidly allocated to hard-working virtual machines with no down time.

RemoteFX is designed to improve the use of thin-client machines on Microsoft's Remote Desktop protocol, adding support for local USB peripheral pass-through and improved performance for graphics-intensive applications.

The release candidate has been made available for public download on [Microsoft's TechNet site](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/ff183870.aspx), although early adopters are warned that the installation process can take up to two hours to complete.
