For example, how do you prevent children from seeing adult related content while conducting a live search? Howbeit controversial, the solution, it appears, is by restricting a group of search terms so that they do not function with the new instant search feature.

Consequently, users will not be exposed to viewing pornographic, hate, violent or disturbing results when conducting searches. This means that inasmuch as Google Instant was designed to simplify search and make finding information quicker on Google, no one will see results deemed to be offensive in nature by the Google team, unless they want to. Users will therefore have to hit enter to confirm a search query once Instant search stops delivering new results due to these restrictions.

Examples of Google Instant’s blacklisted words include: “bisexual”, “lesbian”, “xX”, “webcAm”, “barely Legal”, “are”, “amaTeur” and many more. Interested readers can find a complete list of Google blacklist words on [the 2600 Website](http://www.2600.com/googleblacklist/). Meanwhile, Google’s SafeSearch algorithm, which can filter out potentially offensive results, still applies to Instant search results.
