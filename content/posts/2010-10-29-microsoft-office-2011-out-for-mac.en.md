The package comes with a new version of Microsoft Outlook that has been specially built for Apple’s Mac. The suite supports those cloud based services Windows users have since the launch of Microsoft Office 2010 for this platform.

The reason for launching Microsoft Office for a competitor’s operating system is simple: although the platform is completely different, there are lots of Mac users in this “Windows-centric” world that need to use Microsoft Office. There are also a lot of users who, although they use a Mac for every other task, they prefer to use Microsoft Office.

With the launch of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac, Microsoft offers its users the latest versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and a Mac-specific version of Microsoft Outlook – this one for the first time. The suite works with Microsoft Exchange and is compatible with Microsoft’s cloud-based service, the Office 365.

Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac is available in 13 languages.
