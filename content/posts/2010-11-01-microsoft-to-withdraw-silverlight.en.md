It seems that Microsoft is betting on HTML5 as the future for cross platform development.

They even claim that Silverlight is now a Windows Phone development toolkit (read this article from [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834?tag=nl.e539)).

So it is really safe to continue your developments on this platform ? The interest of Microsoft to buying Adobe is now more clear, as I think Adobe will be best positioned for generating HTML5 interfaces, mixing Flex and Dreamweaver experiences.
