The problem is within authplay.dll and the corresponding .lib in the Unix versions. It allows attackers to inject malicious code like Trojans with specially prepared documents or Flash objects.

The company works on a patch which it plans to release on the 9th of November. Until then, deleting the authplay library helps to prevent a successful attack. Flash or Reader will crash then when a file requests the services from authplay, but this is clearly better than having an infected system.
