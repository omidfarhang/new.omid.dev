[Google Scribe](http://scribe.googlelabs.com/) may not seem very useful, but it's one of the features that could significantly improve virtual keyboards from mobile phones. Instead of showing suggestions from a dictionary, Google Scribe can provide contextually-relevant suggestions.

[Scrybe](http://www.appidio.com/apps/scrybe/) is a free Android keyboard that uses Google Scribe to generate suggestions. It's not developed by Google and it uses an unofficial Google Scribe API, but it's an interesting application.

Scrybe needs to fix many issues to become really useful. If you delete some letters from word, Scrybe is not able to detect that you're not writing a new word. Another problem is that you can't type very fast because Scrybe tries to fetch the suggestions.

[Reddit users](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dyclw/google_scribe_comes_to_the_android_keyboard/) think that [SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.net/) has a better approach: it preloads the data, so there's no lag. “So this is basically the same thing as SwiftKey, but offloaded to Google's servers? Seems to work well, but no better (and slower) than SwiftKey,” [says Podspi](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dyclw/google_scribe_comes_to_the_android_keyboard/c13unek). SwiftKey is $3.99 and there's a two-week trial.
