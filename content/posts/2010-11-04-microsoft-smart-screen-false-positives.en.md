Initially, we considered the possibility of an infected ad service. But it may be a bug in Smartfilter as well. Some reports on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23smartscreen" target="_blank">twitter</a> show that the problem has been resolved.

Please let us know if you have sample URLs that are still affected.

To disable smart screen: Select &#8220;Internet Options&#8221; from the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu. Select the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab and find the &#8220;Enable SmartScreen Filter&#8221;Â  setting (about the 10th item from the bottom. Scroll all the way down). Needless to say: This will also remove the smart screen protection from real-evil sites, not just from appear-to-be-evil-to-smartscreen-today sites. The setting should only be changed if you can't wait for the problem to be fixed.
