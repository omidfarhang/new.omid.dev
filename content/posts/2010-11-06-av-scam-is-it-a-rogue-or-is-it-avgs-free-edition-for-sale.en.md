Tom Kelchner, Sunbelt blog: Alert reader Laurie (my boss actually) forwarded a copy an email she received from a friend. It said the sender was “…pleased to announce the newest version of Antivirus 2010 for Windows.”

There was a link to click, of course.

[<img title="Antivirus2010_email" border="0" alt="Antivirus2010_email" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUxrVk_wAI/AAAAAAAADDQ/6juSASm1v-U/Antivirus2010_email_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="304" height="144" />](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUxpOez26I/AAAAAAAADDM/8xAKKq2UT9E/s1600-h/Antivirus2010_email%5B2%5D.png)

Something called “Antivirus 2010” for sale in November is very odd for three reasons: 

1) It’s nearly 2011 and legitimate AV companies are putting out their 2011 versions.  
2) There was a rogue security product last year called “Antivirus 2010.”  (VIPRE detection: FraudTool.Win32.Antivirus2010 (v))  
3) Although a lot of companies make a product named Anti-Virus 2010, they usually put their name in front of it, such as “Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010” or “Norton AntiVirus 2010.”

The Antivirus 2010 rogue graphic interface from 2009:

We checked out the URL (officialversion.ru) in the email, putting in our name and “promotion code” (actually any number will do) , went past the “member login page” that made some mentions of the very legitimate AVG anti-virus company, and went on to a credit card payment page. The REAL AVG company (fourth largest AV vendor in the world) offers “AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition 2011” in addition to security software that users purchase.

We noticed the logo on the page mimicked the colors of the AVG logo:

[<img title="Antivirus2010_AVG_logo" border="0" alt="Antivirus2010_AVG_logo" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUyDDgfgeI/AAAAAAAADDo/AvD7eNYoPAA/Antivirus2010_AVG_logo_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="155" height="65" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUyBLDYq_I/AAAAAAAADDk/dlauRdpGLA4/s1600-h/Antivirus2010_AVG_logo%5B2%5D.png)

The prices:  
&#8212; $2.49 per month.  
&#8212; A two-year “Full Access & Support” choice for $17.49 per month  
&#8212; Three year “VIP” access for $11.67 per year.  
&#8212; (optional add on) Firewall for $14.88 – marked down from $39.95  
&#8212; (optional) Antivirus Pro Version Updates for $8.95.

[<img title="Antivirus2010_download_03" border="0" alt="Antivirus2010_download_03" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUyIra-INI/AAAAAAAADDw/O1G_v9UAV2o/Antivirus2010_download_03_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="304" height="205" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNUyGM8-o_I/AAAAAAAADDs/e1ctFU5IQcs/s1600-h/Antivirus2010_download_03%5B2%5D.jpg)

We didn’t make a purchase, so, we don’t really know what’s behind the “pay now” button however, you can be sure it isn’t anything good.

We can pretty well conclude that the scam email is offering:

&#8212; A rogue security product  
&#8212; AVG’s Anti-Virus Free Edition, except they charge you before they redirect your browser to AVG’s site for download.  
&#8212; Something else called “Antivirus 2010” that has no visible presence on the Web.

AVG’s real page is here: <http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage>

Thanks Laurie. Thanks Doug. Thanks Patrick.
