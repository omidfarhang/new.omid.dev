Since Chrome is automatically updated, most people use the latest version of the software [a few days after it's released](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/05/google-chrome-most-effective-updater.html).  
Google's help articles aren't the only ones that [ignore Chrome's version number](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2010/09/google-chrome-latest-version.html). Yahoo has recently [released a report](http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/03/gbs-update-2010q4/) that recommends developers to assume that Chrome users are running the latest version.

&#8220;Chrome has been progressing rapidly through versions, and Google has communicated its intent to continue rapid development and short release cycles. As a result, we've modified our strategy for Chrome to advise testing on the latest [generally available] release of Chrome as soon as it is issued, with prior versions moving to X-grade as soon as they are superseded.&#8221;

Now that Google Chrome has a new major release [every six weeks](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/release-early-release-often.html), you won't see too many new features.[Chrome 7 focuses](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2010/10/bringing-another-chrome-release-to-you.html) on &#8220;hundreds of bug fixes&#8221;, while [Chrome 8](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/11/beta-channel-update.html) enables the internal PDF viewer. Chrome's releases aren't exciting because the browser is constantly improving and you don't have to wait [one year](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/releasenotes/) or [more](http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/ie8-released-already-obsolete-004160.php) to see the new features.
