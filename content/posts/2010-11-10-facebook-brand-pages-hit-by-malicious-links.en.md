**CNet:** [<img title="facebook(low)" border="0" alt="facebook(low)" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNq93n0sYwI/AAAAAAAADHc/aiZpyQDaI38/facebook%28low%29_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="195" height="59" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TNq91fUQffI/AAAAAAAADHY/Dq-uvdRyLD4/s1600-h/facebook%28low%29%5B2%5D.jpg)The latest security fiasco on Facebook's application platform may involve business pages rather than personal accounts: [Sendible](http://www.sendible.com/), a company that makes software for businesses to manage accounts and presences on various social-media services, looked like it was hit by a virus or hacker on Tuesday afternoon: [TechCrunch pointed out that Sendible-managed brand pages on Facebook appeared to be posting malicious links](http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/09/sendible-facebook-hack/).

Now Sendible's claiming it wasn't their fault. &#8220;Just to clarify, Sendible was not hacked,&#8221; the company posted to its Twitter account. &#8220;One of our users has discovered a major flaw in Facebook's security.&#8221; Sendible's Twitter account then quoted the user in question, who said, &#8220;i wanted to post only on a few Facebook walls as a fan &#8211; and for some reason, posted as the page Owner. weird,&#8221; and Sendible added &#8220;This appears to be a bug in Facebook's API as the posts should have been displayed as the user profile and not the page owner.&#8221;

The malicious links, which read &#8220;Change Your Facebook Background Here!&#8221;, were showing up on brand pages as major as Coca-Cola, Google, and &#8220;South Park.&#8221;

One Facebook page administrator [wrote on Twitter that the sketchy link-posting appeared to be automated](http://twitter.com/#!/Mazy/status/2111588081336320) and that it attempted to post multiple times. The details don't completely add up, with the situation certainly looking like a hack of Sendible but with the company itself indicating that the problem is on Facebook's end.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
