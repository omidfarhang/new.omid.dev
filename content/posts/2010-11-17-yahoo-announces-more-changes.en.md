**THE INTERNET SEARCH OUTFIT** without a search engine, Yahoo has announced a package of products that it hopes will make it more relevant again.

At the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco, Yahoo showed off a host of products that it claimed would deliver to consumers a more “personally relevant Web experience with new social and local features”.

You guessed it, more social networking and more experiences than you can poke a stick at.

Yahoo's updates include Twitter and Zynga integration, the global rollout of its Messenger Beta with new social features, the launch of its Local Offers program, and local search apps for taking action right from the search results page.

Yahoo claims that its new role is to connect punters with the people, places and things that matter most to them.

Apparently some people think that making a restaurant reservation, finding a discounted tee time or playing online games with friends are very important.

Blake Irving, Yahoo EVP and chief product officer said that the changes will make Yahoo an even better place for everyone to stay entertained, productive, and informed.

All of these new features are built on Yahoo's cloud and technology platforms, which apparently allow for “in-depth partner integrations”.
