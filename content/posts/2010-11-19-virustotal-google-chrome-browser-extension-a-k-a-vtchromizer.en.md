[![VirusTotal-logo](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TOas_hGB2KI/AAAAAAAADLQ/6KPmmBR4tZ0/VirusTotal-logo_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800 "VirusTotal-logo")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TOas92K-UwI/AAAAAAAADLM/n3T-SxL5xdA/s1600-h/VirusTotal-logo%5B3%5D.png)VirusTotal has just coded a Google Chrome browser extension to interact with VirusTotal. The extension adds an option to the context menu to analyze links with VirusTotal's URL analysis engine.

Unlike the VTzilla Firefox extension, it does not embed an additional “Scan with VirusTotal” option in the browser's file download dialog (mainly because Chrome's API does not allow to do so). Having said this, it does include a top menu bar popup that enables quick VirusTotal searches and direct submission of the page being viewed to VirusTotal.
