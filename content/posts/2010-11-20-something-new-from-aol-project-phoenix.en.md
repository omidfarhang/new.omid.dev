Take a look in the email I got from AOL:

Hi!

There are hundreds of millions of people of all ages using email across the globe today. And because communication is often very personal, we realize a one-size-fits-all solution isn't always the right answer. So, while we're proud of the AOL Mail that you know and love today, earlier this week we launched a new email product, code named: Project Phoenix.

One of the reasons we're so excited about Phoenix is because we think it's a great solution for people that want to do more than just email — like text, chat and sharing quick updates with their friends and family. BUT &#8212; for those of you that like your inbox the way it is — don't worry — nothing's changing, and we're happy to continue to support your current AOL Mail experience.

However, we spent a lot of time talking with our users to understand what they might want in a new email experience, and I'm excited to share with you some of the new features of Phoenix: 

  * It's faster&#8230; enough said! 
  * It has more personality — meaning — we've added dots and underscores, as well as new domains (wow.com, love.com, ygm.com and games.com) to help you get the email address you've always wanted (e.g. jane@wow.com or john.doe@love.com). 
  * It's easier to find and view the photos, maps and file attachments contained in your message — all in one place.

We'll be rolling Phoenix out to everyone early next year, but in appreciation of our loyal email users — that's you! — we wanted to let you know that this new product is coming.  
If you're interested in being one of the first to try Phoenix, you can go to <a href="http://invite.aol.com/invite/mail/request_invite?campaign=mail_beta&#038;site=www.phoenix.aol.com&#038;next=http://phoenix.aol.com/login" target="_blank">phoenix.aol.com</a> 

and put yourself on the invite list.

We're proud and honored to have you as an AOL customer, and we hope to continue providing you with the best communications experience on the Web.

Thank you!
