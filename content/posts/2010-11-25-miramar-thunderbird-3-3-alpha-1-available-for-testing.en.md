Miramar Alpha 1, [available here for download](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/early_releases/downloads/), is for testers, extension developers, and other friends who are curious to follow the development of the next release of Thunderbird.

[Miramar Alpha 1](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/3.3a1/) is built on top of the next generation of Mozillaâ€™s layout engine, Gecko 2.0 and includes a new Addon Manager and over 190 platform fixes to improve performance and stability. We expect to release further interim releases as we work towards a major new release of Thunderbird.
