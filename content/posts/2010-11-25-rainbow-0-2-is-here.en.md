  * They added preliminary support for writing multiplexed media frames to a [websocket](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/). 
  * JS callers are now able to specify custom video resolutions, encoding quality, audio sampling rates and channels. 
  * Numerous bug fixes, such as behaving correctly on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), and generating correctly encoded OGG files (the audio tracks of which were previously unplayable by Firefox).
