It's been halted upon Apple's request before it ever went on sale, similarly to those HyperMac batteries before it. _9to5Mac_ first reported the news based on a source close to the company and we just confirmed it directly with the PhotoFast GM2\_SFV1\_Air product manager. The risk of losing access to Apple's product licensing program was just too grave a threat to ignore. So, enjoy your 160MBps max SSD transfer rate and 128GB top-end capacity MBA 11 owners, you'll get your storage and 250MBps sequential read/write speed bumps only when Apple's good and ready to provide it themselves â€” possibly sooner, we're told, if PhotoFast is given the green light to start sales after Toshiba's SSD modules (Apple's MBA partner) are available for purchase.
