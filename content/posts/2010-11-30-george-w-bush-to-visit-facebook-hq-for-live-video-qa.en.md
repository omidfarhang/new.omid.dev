Bush’s book tour will stop at Facebook’s headquarters in Palo Alto on Monday, with the social networking site announcing a “Facebook Live” event for 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. 

Bush has been making the media rounds over the past several weeks, appearing on _The Today Show_, _Oprah_ and _The Tonight Show_ among other programs to talk about his memoir “Decision Points.”

Like other Facebook Live events, users will have an opportunity to [ask Bush questions](http://www.facebook.com/facebook/posts/149867161728329#FFSHARE-close), though at this point it’s unclear how the event will be moderated or who will be asking users’ questions.

While this will be the first appearance of Bush (or any U.S. president) on Facebook Live, the 43rd president has been on the site since June, when he set up a Facebook Page. The page currently has more than 600,000 fans and is being used to promote the book and Bush’s various media appearances.
