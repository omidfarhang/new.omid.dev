Reality TV star Kim Kardashian tops the list, which is dominated by celebrities; in fact, seven of the top 10 terms are people, as you can see in the list:

  * Kim Kardashian 
  * Sandra Bullock 
  * Tiger Woods 
  * Lady Gaga 
  * Barack Obama 
  * Hairstyles 
  * Kate Gosselin 
  * Walmart
  * Justin Bieber
  * free

Kardashian’s online dominance extends beyond searches, however. You may recall that a recent study pegged her as the celeb that gets the most traffic to their website via Twitter (despite not having the largest audience).

Many of the other celebs on the list were involved in major news stories over the past year (Tiger Woods, Sandra Bullock) or exploded onto the scene out of relative obscurity (Bieber, Gaga). Kate Gosselin was the only person on the list for the second straight year.

We’ll soon see if Kardashian also tops Google and Yahoo’s search rankings, which are typically released around this time.
