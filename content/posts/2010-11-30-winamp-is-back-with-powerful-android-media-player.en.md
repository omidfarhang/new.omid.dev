To date, DoubleTwist has been the best option, but Winamp for Android is a powerful new alternative. 

Before the turn of the century (a.k.a. the Wild West of file sharing), Winamp reigned supreme for MP3 playback on Windows. Now I haven’t used a Winamp product since I learned about [foobar2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar2000) back in 2002, but it’s often nice to see the resurgence of a familiar face in tech.

Despite all its fancy features, Winamp is a winner because it’s just a very solid audio player. This isn’t to say that the features aren’t nice. [Winamp for Android](http://blog.winamp.com/2010/11/30/winamp-for-android/) supports wireless desktop syncing (via [Winamp 5.6](http://www.winamp.com/media-player) for PC), so you can simply beam tracks to your device over Wi-Fi. It also has Last.fm scrobbling support and particularly good play queue management.

But don’t take my word for it, check out the free download yourself by scanning the QR code below:
