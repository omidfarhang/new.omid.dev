In continue from [Days are still going on, but how?–Part4](/2010/11/29/days-are-still-going-on-but-how-part4/ "Days are still going on, but how?–Part4")

I got letter from Military office to say when I must go, it had an additional paper saying how much I must pay to them by going to which bank, Thanks God we don’t pay for breathing at least!

Last night before going I tried to sleep sooner than other night, so I went to bed 2:00AM, not 4:00AM like other nights!![Open-mouthed smile](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TPanVWzIhPI/AAAAAAAADUk/bcfTbLic9xI/wlEmoticon-openmouthedsmile%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800) , in the morning I tried to wake up early to be in there on time, I could (Almost! not really!) wake up soon, not on time, after breakfast and collecting everything that I thought is needed in there, I left the home, Suddenly I remember that I’ve not to bank yet, grrr, it’s 7:45 AM now and banks will open at 8:00, also I must be at 8:00AM in the office, so I went to the office and hope I find the bank near the office, in the street where Army office is, I found the bank, good thing!, I paid that much they asked in the paper and continue the way to the office, after giving my mobile to them and then body checking, I went in, woah! how many people are coming today?!

I’ve been there about 8:10AM, but until 10:00AM nothing happened, they started calling names, after about half a clock, they called my name, I gave them receipt from bank and also their invite I got, and went inside their doctor room, he took my medical documents, after reading some of them, he said:

> Well… emmm…. _(while reading)_ for your blood pressure, you don’t combat _(just meaning no need to much activity)_, nothing about liver…(WTF!)… and for your Thyroid, you need recheck by another Hospital.

Is not he kidding me? again recheck by another Hospital??? all I said in there did not works, so I had to go to another Hospital!

To be continued….
