It fixes [13 security vulnerabilities](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2010/12/stable-beta-channel-updates.html) of which 4 got rated “high”ly critical – the people reporting these all got rewarded with 1.000 US-$ and 500 US-$, respectively. Additionally to these security fixes, the update to Chrome 8.0.552.215 contains more than 800 bugfixes and stability improvements according to the Google developers.

The new version officially includes and uses the built-in, stripped-down PDF reader which is additionally secured with a sandbox. This feature, tied together with Googles sandboxing of the browser processes in general and including and updating the Flash Player automatically makes Chrome one of the most secure, yet full-featured web browsers currently available.

Users of Chrome should get the update automatically. To check if the updates are installed already, checking the “About Chrome” menu entry will show the version number and ask to install the update, if that didn’t happen already.
