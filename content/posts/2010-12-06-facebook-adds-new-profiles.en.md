**Avira TechBlog:** [<img title="facebook(low)" border="0" alt="facebook(low)" align="right" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TP04hygZ9tI/AAAAAAAADVo/p43HQ7A4qOQ/facebook%28low%29_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="195" height="59" />](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TP04gWD_iKI/AAAAAAAADVk/wVZtq9hZlaQ/s1600-h/facebook%28low%29%5B3%5D.jpg)Facebook offers a “[new profile](https://www.facebook.com/about/profile/)” feature that many users adopt very fast. It is possible to mark the best friends and family and show them more prominently with their pictures. Also, it accumulates information like the uers’ work places, where they are living and so on. Even projects and co-workers can be shown now.

This may be a useful addition for many users. But it should be used with care; in the end, this feature gives Facebook a deeper insight and more valuable data. Before marking family members, friends and colleagues more prominently in the own profile, users should ask for permission.

It is always a good idea to think about what should be posted on such a public web site: What would my employer think about that? Or future employers? And what about my friends? The Internet never forgets and thus a post out of fun today can become a serious disadvantage later.
