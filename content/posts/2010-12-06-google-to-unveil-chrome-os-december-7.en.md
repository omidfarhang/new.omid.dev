Google’s Chrome team has sent out invites to a press event in San Francisco, “where we plan to share some exciting news about Chrome,” the invitation reads.

The event will be hosted at DogPatch Labs’ San Francisco office on Tuesday, December 7 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. PT. We will be reporting live from the event.

We expect the team will unveil the long-awaited Chrome OS, the first operating system Google has designed for traditional computers, such as desktop PCs, laptops and netbooks, rather than smartphones and/or tablets.

Chrome OS was first announced in July 2009.
