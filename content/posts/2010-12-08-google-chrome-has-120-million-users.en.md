That’s 50 million more users than it had less than seven months ago. 

Chrome is Google’s webkit-based web browser. Launched in September 2008, the browser has gone from zero market share to nearly 10% market share. It’s known for its lightweight design and fast JavaScript rendering.

How fast is Google’s web browser growing, though? At its developer conference in May, Google announced that Chrome had 70 million users. That means the browser has increased its user base by around 40% in six and a half months. That’s some serious growth.

In comparison, Firefox — currently the second most popular browser in the world — surpassed 1 billion downloads last year. There’s a big difference between users and downloads, but it gives a reference point for Chrome’s growth in the past two years.
