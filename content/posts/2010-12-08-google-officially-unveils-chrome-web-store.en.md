Think of the Web Store as the App Store, but for the Chrome browser. The apps work both in the Chrome web browser and in Googleâ€™s upcoming Chrome OS.

Google showcased some of the apps that will be available in the Web Store from companies like NPR, _[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/chrome/)_, EA and Amazon.com.

Google will be rolling out the Chrome Web Store to Chrome users later today and it will be accessible via [https://chrome.google.com/webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/).
