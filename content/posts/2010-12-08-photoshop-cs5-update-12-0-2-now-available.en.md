  * A number of potential security vulnerabilities have been addressed 
  * Crashing bugs related to typography & fonts have been addressed 
  * Performance of various features has been improved 
  * Crashes related to opening 3D layers, sharpening, color management, and scanning via TWAIN devices have been fixed 
  * Problems with brush cursors, the histogram progress bar, the display of selection boundaries (“marching ants”), scrolling while using the shift key, and the use of action droplets have been addressed 
  * Intermittent file format problems have been addressed 
  * Metadata-related bugs related to focus distance and Orphea Studio JPEGs have been fixed

In addition you can download a [TWAIN plug-in update](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=4904) that includes fixes for multiple document scanning, and a that fixes a crash that could occur when attempting a second scan.
