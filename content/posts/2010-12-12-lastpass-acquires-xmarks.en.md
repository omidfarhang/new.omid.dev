In our efforts to bring you expanded, go-anywhere access to your data, we're happy to announce that LastPass recently acquired [Xmarks](http://xmarks.com/)!

Xmarks is a popular browser add-on that syncs bookmarks across all of your computers and smartphones. Just like LastPass, Xmarks can be [installed](http://xmarks.com/) for free on your browsers to give you easy access to your bookmarked sites.  
Xmarks now also offers a [Premium version](http://buy.xmarks.com/premium.php)

with bookmark support on your iPhone and Android, as well as advanced features and priority support. Sign up now to take advantage of the [special discount](https://lastpass.com/features_joinpremiumxmarks.php) with a dual-Premium subscription.

We're excited to welcome Xmarks to the LastPass family, and hope you will support both of these great services!

Thanks,  
The LastPass Team
