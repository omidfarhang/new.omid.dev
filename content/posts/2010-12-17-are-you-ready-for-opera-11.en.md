##### What’s new

###### Tab stacking

Tab stacking is a better way to organize your open tabs. Simply drag one tab on top of another to create a stack. Here is a short video to introduce tab stacking: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hqSGGk1YTI>

###### Extensions

Extensions help you personalize your browser and enhance what Opera can do. More than two million extensions have already been downloaded from <https://addons.opera.com/>. Try the top five most-downloaded extensions for yourself:

  1. [NoAds](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/noads/) authored by Lex1. The top ad-blocking extension for Opera. 
  2. [LastPass](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/lastpass/) authored by lastpass. LastPass is a free password manager and form filler. 
  3. [FastestTube](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/fastesttube-youtube-video-downloader/) &#8211; YouTube Video Downloader authored by fastesttube. Download any video from YouTube. 
  4. [Image preview](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/image-preview-popup/) authored by whochan. Displays a pop-up preview of an image. 
  5. [Translate](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/translate/) authored by neilj. Automagically translates foreign-language webpages.

###### Visual mouse gestures

With the flick of your wrist, mouse gestures let you navigate back and forwards, open new pages, close tabs and so much more. In Opera 11, you now have a handy visual guide to the wonders of mouse gestures.

###### Safer address field

We changed the address bar, so you can make better sense of the security levels of the sites you visit. Opera 11 now displays a clear badge indicating the security level and allowing immediate, one-click access to security and trust information about the site.

##### What we say

“We have always worked hard to introduce new and bold ideas in web browsing,” said Jon von Tetzchner, Co-founder, Opera. “But, sometimes we want to take an idea and improve upon it. Opera 11 adds a layer of polish to features people have known and loved for more than a decade, while introducing extensions. If you have never tried Opera before, Opera 11 will change everything you know about browsing.”

##### The rule of 30

  * Opera 11 is 30 percent smaller than Opera 10.60, so it downloads even faster 
  * Plug-ins can be set to load on-demand. This can improve performance of the browser up to 30 percent.
