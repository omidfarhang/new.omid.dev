SysProtector and APCDefender are potentially very dangerous PC infections. These rogues use fake security alerts and warnings to trick people into thinking their PC is under attack, all the while they drop fake files on the system. These rogues will also prevent other programs from opening, hijack the web browsers and render the PC nearly useless. Below is a screenshot of a hijacked browser, showing fake threat warnings.
