Found this little gem today. It’s distributed with other malware, cracks and drive-by downloads. It purports to be a security warning from your Windows operating system.

Notice the “Visa, MasterCard, etc” – it doesn’t even bother to list all the cards it accepts.

The really cool thing about it is that it takes FAKE credit card numbers as well as real ones!
