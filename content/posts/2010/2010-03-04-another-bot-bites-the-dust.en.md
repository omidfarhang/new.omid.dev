Remember Microsoft's action against 277 Waledac domains last week? Well, that's one way of going after a botnet…

Another way of shutting down a botnet? Arrest the botmasters!

Three Spanish citizens have been arrested for running the “Mariposa” botnet. The three reportedly have no criminal records and have limited hacking skills. Mariposa is a Butterfly Kit based botnet, and the kit is no longer for sale.

Details are available from the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8547453.stm) and [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/03/mariposa_botnet_bust_analysis/). Kudos to those involved in the arrests.
