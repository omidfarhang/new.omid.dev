The future is [here](http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2010/05/translate-real-world-with-google.html) — Google Goggles v.1.1 for Android 1.6 and higher can now read and translate English, French, Italian, German and Spanish language text. 

The Google Goggles translation feature is pretty simple to use. Simply point-and-shot a word or phrase by drawing a box around desired text and snapping a photo. Should Google recognize the text, you can then select the translate button and define the source and destination languages for translation. 

Google has also updated the app with better barcode recognition and enhanced photo recognition for products and logos for a better visual search experience. Ultimately, Google’s goal with Goggles is to solve “the technical challenges required to make computers see.”
