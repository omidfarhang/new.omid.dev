[![digg-260](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S-l5JIuCLuI/AAAAAAAACJw/KhQT9w-1az8/digg-260_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800 "digg-260")](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S-l5HYLCUuI/AAAAAAAACJs/tIwgJDN7Nrk/s1600-h/digg-260%5B3%5D.jpg) Social news site Digg has just laid off 10% of its staff according to a representative from the company. The move comes a month after Jay Adelson’s sudden departure as CEO, in which he was replaced by company founder Kevin Rose. 

Rose writes in an e-mail to employees: “This is one of the hardest decisions we’ve had to make recently but we strongly believe that it is the right decision for the long-term health of the company. In order to achieve our goals, we are putting more emphasis on the engineering and development efforts.” 

The company does say it will actually continue to hire engineers –- consistent with what Adelson told us in a March interview about the company’s strategy, which is focused on a massive overhaul of the site and the way it ranks and orders stories.
