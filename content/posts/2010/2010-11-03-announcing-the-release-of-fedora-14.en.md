### What's New in Fedora 14?

#### For desktop users

A universe of new features for end users: 

  * libjpeg-turbo: Users can load and save images faster in Fedora 14 than in previous releases. 
  * Spice: Spice (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments) provides users with an enhanced remote desktop experience. Currently, it provides the rudimentary foundation to take advantage of things like Accelerated 2D graphics, encryption, and hardware cursor support. 

 

#### For developers

For developers there are all sorts of additional goodies: 

  * D: Fedora 14 introduces support for D, a systems programming language combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages such as Ruby and Python. 
  * Python 2 upgrade: The system python 2 stack has been upgraded to 2.7. 
  * GNUStep: A GUI framework based of the Objective-C programming language which is part of the gcc. 
  * Memory Debugging Tools: The new “gdb-heap” package adds a new “heap” command to /usr/bin/gdb which allows you to get a breakdown of how a process is using dynamic memory. 
  * Rakudo Star: An implementation of Perl version 6, based on the Parrot VM. 
  * Support for Milkymist: Developers can enjoy developing for Milkymist, an open hardware embedded board, on Fedora 14. Thanks to the Fedora Electronic Lab for their work in this regard. 

#### For system administrators

And don't think we forgot about the system administrators: 

  * Fedora is now available for users of the Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud service, released concurrently with the traditional release. 
  * virt-v2v assists in the easy migration of Xen virtual machines to KVM virtual machines. 
  * A Virtualization Technology Preview Repo allows users to test the very latest developments in virtualization related packages. 
  * Varnish has been updated and includes improved scalability and a new log function. 
  * Apache has been updated and includes a number of module and security fixes. 

And that's only the beginning. Updated versions of many packages, as usual, will be available in Fedora 14. A more complete list with more details of the new features on board Fedora 14 is available at:
