To help secure your computer against malware:

> If your computer is already infected or you are in doubt, first look at the [Malware Removal](/2011/01/02/malware-removal-guide-for-Windows) Guide.  

Build up your malware defenses
------------------------------

### Install antivirus and antispyware programs from a trusted source

* Never download anything in response to a warning from a program you didn't install or don't recognize that claims to protect your PC or offers to remove viruses. It is highly likely to do the opposite.
* Get reputable anti-malware programs from a vendor you trust. I recommend [Avira](/knowledge-base/programs/avira-premium-security-suite).
* It's highly recommended that you create another layer of protection beyond [Avira](/knowledge-base/programs/avira-premium-security-suite). This second layer could be composed with [Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware](/knowledge-base/programs/malwarebytes-antimalware), [Hitman Pro](/knowledge-base/programs/hitman-pro) or any other **on-demand** antimalware software.

### Use a safe browser with good extensions

* I recommend [Google Chrome](/knowledge-base/programs/google-chrome) and [Here is](/knowledge-base/programs/google-chrome/extensions) my suggested list of extensions for a safe navigation.

### Update software regularly

Cybercriminals are endlessly inventive in their efforts to exploit vulnerabilities in software, and many software companies work tirelessly to combat these threats. That is why you should:

* Regularly install updates forallyour software—antivirus and antispyware programs, browsers (like Windows Internet Explorer), operating systems (like Windows), and word processing and other programs. [Learn how to update your system](/knowledge-base/how-to/maintenance/check-for-update).
* Uninstall software that you don't use. You can remove it using Windows Control Panel.

### Use strong passwords and keep them secret

* Strong passwords are at least 14 characters long and include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.[Find out how to create them](/knowledge-base/security/passwords).
* Don't share passwords with anyone.
* Don’t use the same password on all sites. If it is stolen, all the information it protects is at risk.
* Create different strong passwords for the router and the wireless key of your wireless connection at home. Find out how from the company that provides your router.

### Never turn off your firewall

A firewall puts a protective barrier between your computer and the Internet. Turning it off for even a minute increases the risk that your PC will be infected with malware. [Learn more about Firewalls](/knowledge-base/security/personal-firewall).

### Use flash drives cautiously

Minimize the chance that you'll infect your computer with malware:

**Note**: If you use [Avira AntiVir](/knowledge-base/programs/avira-premium-security-suite) you are protected against Autorun malwares since it will block all Autoruns from Removable Drives (Expect CD/DVD by Default).

* Don't put an unknown flash (or thumb) drive into your PC.
* Hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the drive into your computer. If you forget to do this, click ![](/rsrc/1298586349299/computer/malware/prevention/close_orange.png) in the upper-right corner to close any flash drive-related pop-up windows.
* Don't open files on your drive that you're not expecting.

### Immunize your computer having any traffic to malware domains

* You can block your computer from download anything from malware domains using windows [Hosts File](/knowledge-base/security/hosts-file), [Learn more here](/knowledge-base/security/hosts-file/protect-hosts-file).

Don't be tricked into downloading malware
-----------------------------------------

Instead, follow this advice:

* Be very cautious about opening attachments or clicking links in email or IM, or in posts on social networks (like Facebook)—even if you know the sender. Call to ask if a friend sent it; if not, delete it or close the IM window.
* Avoid clicking Agree,OK, or 'I accept' in banner ads, in unexpected pop-up windows or warnings, on websites that may not seem legitimate, or in offers to remove spyware or viruses.
  * Instead, pressCTRL + F4on your keyboard.
  * If that doesn’t close the window, pressALT + F4on your keyboard to close the browser. If asked, close all tabs and don’t save any tabs for the next time you start the browser.
* Only download software from websites you trust. Be cautious of "free" offers of music, games, videos, and the like. They are notorious for including malware in the download.
