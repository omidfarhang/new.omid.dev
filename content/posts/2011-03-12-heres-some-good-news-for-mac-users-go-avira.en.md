_Avira provides anti-malware scanning engine to MacKeeper App_

**Tettnang / Silicon Valley, March 11, 2011 – IT security expert Avira announced today that it licensed its industry-leading antivirus product to Silicon Valley-based ZeoBIT to be used in ZeoBIT’s MacKeeper product. MacKeeper is an all-in-one app that includes 16+ unique features for security, cleaning, data control and optimization for Macintosh computers.**

Designed as a 911 app for Mac OS that will keep a Mac secured, clean, reliable, fast and up to date, MacKeeper provides:

  * Protection from both Mac OS and Windows threats 
  * Detection of viruses, identity thefts, phishing, spyware and malware 
  * Web browsing safety by revealing fraudulent websites and unsafe downloads

“It’s true that Macs do not suffer from as many attacks and viruses than their Windows-based counterparts, but Avira feels that because Macs exchange files with all other operating systems, the opportunity for malware to infect a Mac is increasing every day,” said Sascha Beyer, CTO, Avira. “It’s mandatory today to have protection on a Mac, and Avira is very pleased that our technology is being used to protect Mac devices.”

The licensing agreement allows ZeoBIT to use Avira’s Secure Anti-Virus API, the official interface for Avira’s anti-malware scanning engine. The Avira scanning technology is integrated into a service, which runs in background and accepts scanning requests from MacKeeper.

“Since our launch last fall with MacKeeper 1.0, ZeoBIT has been busy making our security product for Macs the best it can be and we’re certainly pleased to add the security prowess of Avira to our product,” said Slava Kolomiychuk, CEO, ZeoBIT LLC. “Mac users are facing increasing amounts of malware and our goal is to protect them so they never have to worry about being compromised.”
