TechSpot wrote: Microsoft this week reportedly signed off the Release to Manufacturing (RTM) build of Internet Explorer 9. The RTM build is 9.00.8112.16421.110308-0330, meaning it was compiled on March 8, 2011 at 3:30 AM, according to [Windows 8 Beta](http://windows8beta.com/2011/03/internet-explorer-9-rtw-build-9-00-8112-16421-110308-0330-compiled). 

A user by the name of sp3ciali5t has managed to post an image of the IE9 about screen for this build on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/sp3ciali5t/status/45587083791831041). It's in Turkish, but you can still the build number:

Earlier this week, Microsoft confirmed that IE9 would be launching on March 14, 2011 at 9:00 AM PST. The company will hold a launch party in Austin, Texas during the South by Southwest Interactive Festival (SXSWi), but not before a press briefing where IE senior director Ryan Gavin said there will still be &#8220;a few surprises.&#8221;

Microsoft unveiled the first IE9 public preview in March 2010. This was followed by multiple further public previews as well as a public beta in September 2010. Last month, Microsoft released a public IE9 Release Candidate build.

IE9 will be available in 32-bit and 64-bit flavors for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Users of Windows XP will thus not be able to upgrade past IE8.
