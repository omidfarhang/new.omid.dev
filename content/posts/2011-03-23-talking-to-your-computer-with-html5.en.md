Fresh from the work that we’ve been doing with the [HTML Speech Incubator Group](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/htmlspeech/), we’ve added support for the[HTML5 speech input API](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xg-htmlspeech/2011Feb/att-0020/api-draft.html). With this API, developers can give web apps the ability to transcribe your voice to text. When a web page uses this feature, you simply click on an icon and then speak into your computer’s microphone. The recorded audio is sent to speech servers for transcription, after which the text is typed out for you. Try it out yourself in [this little demo](http://slides.html5rocks.com/#speech-input). Today’s beta release also offers a sneak peek of GPU-accelerated [3D CSS](http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/), which allows developers to apply slick 3D effects to web page content using [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets).

Lastly, as mentioned in yesterday's [blogpost](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/03/fresh-take-on-icon.html), those of you on the beta channel will start seeing the brand new shiny Chrome icon on your desktops.

Stay tuned as we make all these updates widely available in the stable channel soon!
