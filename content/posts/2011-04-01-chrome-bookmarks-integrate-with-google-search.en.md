**Google Operation System:** Until recently, [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/) and [Chrome Bookmarks](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/topic.py?topic=14680) were two separate features that didn't speak the same language. Even if you could save your Chrome bookmarks to a Google account, they weren't saved to Google Bookmarks. For some reason, your bookmarks are available in a special Google Docs folder.

Chrome bookmarks have a web interface, but it's likely that the obvious will happen: Chrome bookmarks could be saved to Google Bookmarks. [Jérôme Flipo noticed](http://blogoscoped.com/forum/178276.html) that the Google Bookmarks OneBox already includes Chrome bookmarks. I've tried to find SmallNetBuilder.com and Google's OneBox returned it even if it was starred in Chrome, not in Google Bookmarks.
