**Google Operation System:** [Google +1](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/1s-right-recommendations-right-when-you.html) is yet another attempt to make Google more social. It's Google's version of the Facebook &#8220;likes&#8221;, a simple feature that's very powerful because it's part of a social network.

Google will show +1 buttons next to all search results and ads, while encouraging other sites to include the buttons. All +1's are public and they're tied to Google Profiles. The goal is to use this data to personalize search results and ads by recommending sites +1'd by your friends. Google Social Search already does this, but there's no support for Facebook likes, so Google had to come up with a substitute.

&#8220;+1 is the digital shorthand for &#8216;this is pretty cool.' To recommend something, all you have to do is click +1 on a webpage or ad you find useful. These +1's will then start appearing in Google's search results,&#8221; [explains Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/1s-right-recommendations-right-when-you.html).

This feature is slowly rolled out to Google.com, but you can try it by enabling the [+1 search experiment](http://www.google.com/experimental/index.html).

        One thing is clear: Google won't have to translate &#8220;+1&#8221; when it will localize the service, but it will have a hard time translating &#8220;+1's&#8221;, &#8220;+1'd&#8221; and other cryptic constructs. Google +1's URLs already look weird (here's the homepage: <a href="http://www.google.com/+1">http://www.google.com/+1</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Your +1's are listed in <a href="https://profiles.google.com/me/plusones">a profile tab</a>, where you can manage them. There's also <a href="https://profiles.google.com/+1/personalization/">a page</a> that lets you disable personalizing Google ads using +1's and other information from your Google profile.

        Google now has the most important pieces of a social network (profiles, activity stream, likes, apps), but there's still no social network, no magic &#8220;glue&#8221; that connects the existing pieces. As <a href="http://searchengineland.com/meet-1-googles-answer-to-the-facebook-like-button-70569">Danny Sullivan explains</a>, the &#8220;+1 social network&#8221; is made up of your Google Talk friends, the people from Gmail's &#8220;My contacts&#8221; group and the people you follow in Google Reader and Google Buzz, but you'll soon be able to connect other services like Twitter and Flickr. It's actually a meta social network, an artificial service that won't have too many enthusiastic users, just like <a href="http://www.google.com/friendconnect">Friend Connect</a>.
