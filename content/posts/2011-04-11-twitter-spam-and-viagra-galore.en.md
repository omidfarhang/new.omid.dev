Spam mails claiming to be from Twitter that send you to pharmacy sites are a [popular wheeze](http://www.hoax-slayer.com/pharmacy-spam-twitter-messages.shtml) for spammers, and here we go again.

It seems I have “two PR messages from Twitter”. If that wasn't enough to get me clicking (it isn't), I can also join in on sports conversations, argue with bloggers and tell the World when I stumble into some form of natural disaster.

Hammering one of the many links will actually take me to 219(dot)84(dot)119(dot)56/afternoon(dot)html, which will send me to pharmacydrugstorehealthprofessionals(dot)net.

All the Cialis you can eat!

That might not be a good idea though.

Bear in mind that spam blasts like the one above can sometimes lead to [malware most horrid](http://spamnews.com/The-News/Latest/Drive-by-Download-Assault-Masked-With-Canadian-Pharmacy-Site-2010062113277/), so – as always – stay safe (and don't go messing with random pills bought on the internet, either).
