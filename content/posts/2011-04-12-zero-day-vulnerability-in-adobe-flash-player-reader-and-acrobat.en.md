    <a href="http://techblog.avira.com/2011/04/12/zero-day-vulnerability-in-adobe-flash-player-reader-and-acrobat/en/">Avira TechBlog</a>: Adobe released a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa11-02.html">security advisory</a> in which it warns from a zero-day vulnerability within current version of Adobe Flash Player, Reader and Acrobat. Affected are Flash Player 10.2.153.1 and earlier versions for Windows, Mac, Linux and Solaris, the current version integrated in the Chrome web browser, and 10.2.156.12 and earlier versions for Android. The authplay.dll component of current and older version of Adobe Acrobat and Reader are also affected; according to Adobe, the sandbox of Acrobat Reader X prevents from execution of malicious payloads though.

    The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code with manipulated documents. Currently targeted attacks are reported by Adobe which use a Word document with a specially prepared Flash Player file (.swf) embedded to infect victims.

  <p>
    The company currently is finalizing a schedule for updated software versions. Until those updates are available, users should take care of which documents they open. Suspicious are documents which are sent without expecting them.
