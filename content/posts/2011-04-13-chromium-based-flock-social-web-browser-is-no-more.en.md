    <b>H-Online:</b> In a post on their home page, the <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a> developers have announced that support for their Chromium-based social web browser will officially be discontinued on 26 April 2011. Thanking their &#8220;loyal users&#8221; for their support, the developers encourage the Flock community to migrate to another browser.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Flock began life as a cross-platform browser <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Start-up-wants-to-improve-on-Firefox/2100-1032_3-5663798.html">start-up</a> in April 2005. Distinguishing itself from other browsers, Flock automatically managed updates and media from several popular social services, including MySpace, Facebook, Bebo, Digg, YouTube and Twitter.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Prior to version 3.x, the browser was based on Mozilla's Gecko HTML rendering engine, the same used by the 3.x branch of Firefox. However, when the <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Flock-3-Beta-drops-Firefox-switches-to-Chromium-1023489.html">Flock 3 beta</a> arrived, it dropped the engine used by Firefox and switched to Google's open source Chromium browser platform. The last major update to Flock was <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Flock-3-5-social-web-browser-arrives-1145337.html">version 3.5</a> from late November 2010; three point updates were later released to address various bugs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In January of this year, the company was <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Zynga-to-acquire-Flock-social-web-browser-1164494.html">acquired</a> by US game maker <a href="http://www.zynga.com/">Zynga</a>, which is well known for it's popular online games, such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars. While users can continue to use the browser, the company notes that several &#8220;key features will stop working after 4/26/11 and over time the browser will no longer be secure as software updates and upgrades will no longer be provided&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As no further security updates will be provided, the developers encourage all Flock users to upgrade to either Google Chrome or Mozilla's Firefox web browser. An <a href="http://www.flock.com/faq.html">Official End of Support FAQ</a> is available on the company's web site.</div>
