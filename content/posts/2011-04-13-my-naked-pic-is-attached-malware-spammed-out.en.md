<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
  SophosLabs: Are you in the habit of having complete strangers email you naked pictures of themselves?</p> 
  
  <p>
    That's the only reason I can think of that you can legitimately explain why your computer has been infected by the latest malware attack that has been spammed out around the world.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Users are seeing messages in their inbox, which attempt to trick recipients into opening the attached file with the promise of a nude photo.

    <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-16Mw_4n8TSw/TaV_IM14PfI/AAAAAAAAD08/itVFn5GQDgU/s1600/naked-pic.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-16Mw_4n8TSw/TaV_IM14PfI/AAAAAAAAD08/itVFn5GQDgU/s1600/naked-pic.jpg" /></a>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    The messages read
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I love wild sex and looking for a discreet partner.<br />I have my picture attached to this email. Take a look at it and get back if you like what you see.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    and have the subject line &#8220;my naked pic is attached&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sure enough, there is a file attached to the emails (it's called picture.zip) but it isn't a potential sex partner who is contacting you. Instead, the attachment contains a fake anti-virus attack &#8211; designed to con you into believing that your computer has a barrage of security problems, and fool you into handing over your credit card details.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hopefully most people will think with their brains and not with their trousers, and not be tempted into opening the attachment. However, experience has shown that even a malicious attack as obvious as this is likely to capture some unwary computer users.
