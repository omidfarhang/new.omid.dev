    <b>Avira TechBlog:</b> This is good news – for the recently acknowledged <a href="http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2011/04/zero-day-vulnerability-in-adobe-flash.htmlr-and-acrobat/en/">zero-day security vulnerability</a> within Adobe Flash Player, Acrobat and Reader there will be a first update available tomorrow. Adobe updated their <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa11-02.html">security advisory</a> on that matter to reflect the update schedule – the Flash player update fixing the vulnerability for Windows, Mac, Linux and Solaris will be available tomorrow, Friday, April 15.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the also vulnerable Adobe Reader and Acrobat, updates <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/psirt/2011/04/update-on-security-advisory-for-adobe-flash-player-adobe-reader-and-acrobat-apsa11-02.html">are planned</a> “no later than the week of April 25, 2011″. The only exception is Adobe Reader X for Windows which will be updated on the regular planned Patchday on June 14, as the integrated sandbox prevents successful exploitation there according to Adobe.

    Please be prepared to download and install the update tomorrow as soon as it is available!
