  Sophos Labs: Repeat after me: It's &#8220;Facebook&#8221;, not &#8220;FaceBook&#8221;.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Learn that lesson and it can be one of the tricks you can use to protect yourself against a spammed-out malware campaign, which tries to trick you into believing that Facebook support has changed your password.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Computer users are receiving emails claiming that the popular social network has automatically changed their password to secure their account.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's a typical message:
  </p>
  
  <div>
    <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yBO62vNmKmU/TaanHS6urpI/AAAAAAAAD1w/0nTf3Fu7-j8/s1600/facebook-password-change.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yBO62vNmKmU/TaanHS6urpI/AAAAAAAAD1w/0nTf3Fu7-j8/s1600/facebook-password-change.jpg" /></a>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    </p> 
    
    <div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Dear user of FaceBook.<br />Your password is not safe!<br />To secure your account the password has been changed automatically.<br />Attached document contains a new password to your account and detailed information about new security measures.<br />Thank you for attention,<br />Administration of Facebook.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        Your alarm bells should be ringing instantly when you receive this message for a number of reason, not least that it can't decide if it's &#8220;Facebook&#8221; or &#8220;FaceBook&#8221;, but also because why would Facebook ever email you an attachment? And why are they being so impersonal and not using your name?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Subject lines used in this malicious campaign include &#8220;Facebook. Your password has been changed! [NUMBER]&#8221; and &#8220;Facebook. The new password to your account. [NUMBER]&#8221; and even &#8220;Facebook Support. Personal data has been changed! [NUMBER]&#8221;, and in each case the email is accompanied by an attached zip file which pretends to contain the new password.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        However, the real payload of the file is to infect your Windows computer with Malware Zbot-AV.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So, just because an email claims to hail from password@facebook.com, support@facebook.com or message@facebook.com, realise that its headers could have been forged &#8211; and don't blindly follow its instructions unless you're absolutely certain it's legitimate.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Perhaps the easiest thing to do if you're told your Facebook password has been changed, is try to log into Facebook to see if it's true or not?
