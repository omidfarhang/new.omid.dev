**Avira TechBlog:** Today some updates need attention – they fix critical security issues and should be installed immediately!

The update reign starts off with Apple. Critical security vulnerabilities [are closed](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4596) within the Safari web browser 5.0.5 – they allowed cyber criminals to smuggle in malware. For Mac users, additionally a [security update](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4608) is available for the Snow Leopard operating system. It fixes an issue with stolen certificates which arose a three weeks ago at Comodo and is amazingly tiny for an Apple security update, only 4 MByte. And then for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users the update to [iOS 4.3.2](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4606) is available which basically closes the same security holes for the mobile devices as well.

As announced by Adobe, the Flash Player update which will be available [during the day](http://boelectronic.blogspot.com/2011/04/adobe-plans-flash-player-update.html) today is already available for users of the Google Chrome web browser. Chrome 10.0.648.205 for Windows, Mac and Linux comes with the new Flash Player plug-in 10.2.154.27. According to the [Chrome Release Blog](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2011/04/stable-channel-update.html), also three critical security vulnerabilities in the GPU process have been fixed. The update should be installed automatically already – to make sure to use the latest version, click on the tool symbol and check the “About Chrome” menu entry.
