    The update reign starts off with Apple. Critical security vulnerabilities <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4596">are closed</a> within the Safari web browser 5.0.5 – they allowed cyber criminals to smuggle in malware. For Mac users, additionally a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4608">security update</a> is available for the Snow Leopard operating system. It fixes an issue with stolen certificates which arose a three weeks ago at Comodo and is amazingly tiny for an Apple security update, only 4 MByte. And then for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users the update to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4606">iOS 4.3.2</a> is available which basically closes the same security holes for the mobile devices as well.
