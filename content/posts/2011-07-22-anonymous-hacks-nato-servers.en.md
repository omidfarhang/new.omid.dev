    <b>The H-Online Security wrote:</b> In a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AnonymousIRC/status/94013224856453120">post</a> on Twitter, the Anonymous hacker group said that it has managed to steal a number of secret documents from one of <a href="http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/index.htm">NATO</a>&#8216;s servers. As proof, Anonymous published two PDF documents from 2007 and 2008 that are allegedly from NATO. The classification &#8220;NATO Restricted&#8221; suggests that the documents are intended only for circulation within the organisation â€“ if they are genuine. The hacktivists say they copied a gigabyte of data in total, but added that it would be &#8220;irresponsible&#8221; to publish most of the material.

    Another <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AnonymousIRC/status/94066518366752768">published</a> document is from 2002 and is entitled &#8220;Security within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)&#8221;; it is apparently not classified. &#8220;Seems nobody ever read them,&#8221; said Anonymous in its tweet. A simple SQL injection was apparently <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AnonymousIRC/status/94012787705122816">all it took</a> to break into the server. Anonymous says that it will be putting more &#8220;interesting data&#8221; online over the next few days.

    NATO has yet to confirm the authenticity of the documents; however its security experts immediately began looking into the case, as a NATO spokesperson told the German press agency <a href="http://www.dpa.de/English.82.0.html">dpa</a>. &#8220;The publication of classified documents is condemnable as it potentially compromises the safety of NATO allies, our armed forces, and citizens,&#8221; said the spokesperson.

    Meanwhile, the hacktivists have reacted to the <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/FBI-arrests-suspected-members-of-Anonymous-1282502.html">arrest</a> of 21 suspected members of Anonymous in the US, the UK and the Netherlands. Along with their allies at LulzSec, they published a <a href="http://pastebin.com/RA15ix7S">reply</a> to a statement made by Steven Chabinsky, deputy assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division. The two hacker groups write that &#8220;while we understand that you and your colleagues may find breaking into websites unacceptable, let us tell you what WE find unacceptable: Governments lying to their citizens and inducing fear and terror to keep them in control by dismantling their freedom piece by piece.&#8221; The hacktivists say these governments and the corporations that work with them are their enemy, adding: &#8220;And we will continue to fight them, with all methods we have at our disposal.&#8221;

    Most of the suspects arrested on Tuesday are accused of having supported the Wikileaks whistle-blowing platform by conducting <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Operation-Payback-protests-via-mouse-click-1150790.html">denial-of-service (DoS) attacks</a>on financial institutions including PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa.</div>
