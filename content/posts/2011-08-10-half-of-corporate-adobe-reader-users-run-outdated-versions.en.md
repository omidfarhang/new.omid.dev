    <b>SOFTPEDIA: According to statistics gathered by cloud security provider Zscaler, 56.4% of enterprise users have out of date Adobe Reader plug-in versions inside their browsers.</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The company gathered statistics about browser plug-ins and presented the results in its &#8220;State of the Web&#8221; report [<a href="http://www.zscaler.com/pdf/Zscaler-Labs-State-of-the-Web-2011Q2.pdf">pdf</a>] for the second quarter of 2011.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>&#8220;Nearly every browser is running some combination of plug-ins, add-ons or extensions. As with most software, older versions of plug-ins typically have more security vulnerabilities. This adds up to a tempting target for hackers,&#8221; </i>the company warns.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adobe Flash is the most widely spread plug-in, being present in 93.62% of browsers scanned by Zscaler. However, only 8.44% of those installations are out of date.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adobe Reader, which is the third-most popular plug-in with an install rate of 83.37% in the corporate environment is much more likely to be outdated.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fortunately, Java, one of the most targeted browser plug-ins, has a very low deployment rate on enterprise computers, only 9.25% of them having it installed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even so, 6.49% of those run an outdated version which supports the theory that Java is commonly attacked because it has a poor update rate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When it comes to corporate networks it is not mass exploitation attacks that are the primary concern, but targeted ones in which attackers exploit vulnerabilities to install information stealing trojans.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>&#8220;These overlooked apps can be exploited to gain full control of an endpoint machine. When that endpoint machine is a member of a corporate domain, the hackers gain full access to all corporate data,&#8221;</i> the Zscaler researchers warn.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's worth noting however that these Adobe Reader stats might not reflect the actual risks. That's because Zscaler has not released a more detailed analysis of the actual versions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Adobe Reader X (10.0) features sandboxing technology which makes it unlikely for attackers to successfully exploit vulnerabilities. This means that computers running any 10.x version, even oudated ones, can be fully protected against attacks.
