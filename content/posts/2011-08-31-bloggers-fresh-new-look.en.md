    <b>Blogger Buzz:</b> As you may have <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/evolving-google-design-and-experience.html">heard</a>, things are starting to look a little different across many Google products—and today, Blogger is the next product to get a makeover.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It’s been a few years since we made major updates to Blogger’s look and feel, and there’s a lot more to these changes than just shiny new graphics. We’ve rewritten the entire editing and management experience from scratch so it’s faster and more efficient for you—and easier for us to update and improve over time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Throughout the design process, we conducted user interviews to help identify how to make Blogger even easier and more enjoyable to use. We also watched users try our new interface and made many refinements based on their feedback.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>A streamlined blogging experience</b><br />Whether you’re on a dashboard or settings page of blogger.com, you can always create or edit posts with just one click at the top of the screen. Additionally, the post editor has been expanded and simplified to give you a larger canvas for drafting and previewing your work.

    <b>Monitor and grow your audience at a glance</b><br />In the new “Overview” section of your dashboard, you’ll be able to quickly get a pulse for how people are reacting to your blog with a graph of your most recent traffic numbers, comment activity and follower counts. For extra guidance and inspiration, you’ll also find a list of helpful links, a feed of Blogger updates and a showcase of other blogs you may find interesting.

  <p>
    <b>Opt in now</b><br />Starting today, we’ll gradually let all bloggers choose to turn on the new UI, so your Blogger experience won’t be updated until you enable it. Over the next few days, keep an eye out for a pop-up announcement on your dashboard with instructions on how to get started, and check out <a href="http://www.google.com/support/blogger/bin/answer.py?answer=1623800">this Blogger Help Center page</a> to learn more about what’s changed.
  </p>

    If you have suggestions or feedback about the new look, click the gear icon in the top right of the navigation bar and select “Send Feedback.”
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We’re working hard to fundamentally revamp and improve the Blogger experience from the ground up, and we hope you enjoy the first in a series of major updates that are on their way in the coming months.
