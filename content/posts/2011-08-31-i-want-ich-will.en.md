I think being well known all over the world is not everything, sometimes I wish fewer people know but that smart group of people that know me, trust me, believe me, hear me, believe me as a human not as a service or an object!It often happens that in a party when all people are talking about various topics, the only topic will talk to me is computer stuff, Yes computer is my favorite topic and I like it and I can talk about it for long time non-stop, but when someone know nothing about computer try talk to me about computer, it happens that I feel this is kind of a fake respect to me, they want to help me feel better in their meeting or party bla bla…

Another scenario is when I'm not in a meeting, I'm at home and my phone rings, ah! someone wants to say Hi and did not forget me!!, I answer the phone and after greeting I realize that yeah, again they have a computer problem and that's the reason they remembered that there are a someone named Omid which they can say Hi!, Why don't call me when they are happy or sad to share their happiness or let me help them when they are sad…?

I know that I'm not a very chatty or conversational human, but I can talk about things too, cannot I?  
Now now, I'm not asking hey please talk to me! It's not your fault! I'm asking what I've done that this happen? What problem you have noticed in me that cause people think of me like this? What's the reason?  
Is that because I'm usually silent?  
Is that because I'm too cold?  
Is that because I'm not friendly in a conversation?  
Or…? Please tell me!

Have a good day!
