    <b>SophosLabs</b>: Even if it hasn't been officially announced yet, and certainly isn't available to the general public (unless an Apple employee <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/sep/01/apple-staffer-loses-iphone">loses a test model in a bar</a>), there are plenty of scammers out there trying to trick you into believing you can get a free iPhone 5.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here's just a sample of the pages on Facebook claiming to be an iPhone 5 giveaway. Typically they are trying to trick you into clicking on links, driving traffic to online surveys which earns them revenue.

    <br />Repeat after me ðŸ™‚ </p> 
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is no free iPhoneÂ 
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no free iPadÂ 
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Very, very occasionally, you will meet people who got an iPad &#8220;for free&#8221;. For example, the Naked Security team won one at this year's Security Bloggers awards when they were named &#8220;Most Educational Security blog&#8221;. ðŸ™‚
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But for every free iPhone or iPad offered, there are probably 10,000,000 or more fake offers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So if you simply assume ALL &#8220;free&#8221; iPads and iPhones offered online are scams, you're missing out on a one-in-a-ten-million chance. In other words, you're missing what is mathematically almost indistinguishable from nothing, zero, zilch.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But each time you enter one of these online giveaways, you could be handing over your personal information to scammers and putting money into their pockets.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And you don't want to do that, do you?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It's widely anticipated that Apple will announce the iPhone 5 sometime this month. But don't hold your breath about them offering it for free.
