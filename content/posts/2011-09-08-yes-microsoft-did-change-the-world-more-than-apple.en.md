    <b>Business Insider</b>: A new <a href="http://www.challenges.fr/actualite/high-tech/20110907.CHA3744/pour-les-francais-microsoft-a-davantage-change-le-monde-qu-apple.html">poll</a> in France says 7 out of 10 people think Microsoft did more to change the world than Apple. We think we would have similar results in other countries, if only because a lot more people (still!) use Microsoft products than Apple products, at least for personal computing which is (still!) the most important part of computing.

    It's hard to see a mention of Steve Jobs without the worlds &#8220;change the world&#8221; or &#8220;changing an industry.&#8221; And let's give him his due. Let's give him his due as one of the greatest entrepreneurs in history, as an amazing entrepreneur and visionary who left many &#8220;dents&#8221; in the universe. And he did change many industries, like music, film, and yes, personal computing.
