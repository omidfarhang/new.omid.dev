    SophosLabs:Â Following the widely-publicised disgrace of Dutch digital certificate issuer <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/09/05/operation-black-tulip-fox-its-report-on-the-diginotar-breach/">DigiNotar</a>, a person calling himself ComodoHacker <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/09/07/globalsign-stops-issuing-ssl-certificates-in-response-to-iranian-hacker/">claimed</a> that he'd breached four other Certificate Authorities (CAs), too.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Only one of these CAs was named: GlobalSign, the world's fifth-biggest issuer of digital certificates.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In my opinion, GlobalSign would have been justified in ignoring this claim altogether.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It comes across as a stream of made-up, self-serving puffery, including bluster like this:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <tt>You see? I'm so smart, sharp, dangerous, powerful, etc. huh?</tt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <tt>May I also start a web hacking course for Anonymous and Lulzsec and friends of them, Rootkit development for Stuxnet developers, 0-day vuln. assessment in Windows and Linux environment for Stuxnet developers and other hackers too. huh? What do you think?</tt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <tt>WOOOOORLLLLDDD! Wait for me, you have so much more SHOCKINGS to see from me! From a person who came to this world just 21 years ago! JUST WAIT!</tt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    But GlobalSign decided, like <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/1henryiv/full.html" rel="nofollow">Shakespeare's Falstaff</a>, that the better part of valour is discretion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The company suspended its certificate-issuing business to investigate whether ComodoHacker's unlikely claims might have a whiff of truth. GlobalSign even retained Fox-IT, the consultants called in to investigate the DigiNotar disaster, for some objective outside help.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The good news is that everything at GlobalSign to do with certificate signing appears to be in good shape, and the company will resume business-as-usual this week.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The bad news, of course, is that the company had a week's business outage as a result.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ironically, even after GlobalSign had given itself the all-clear in respect of certificate signing, it <a href="http://www.globalsign.com/company/press/090611-security-response.html" rel="nofollow">reported an apparently-inconsequential breach</a> against its web server.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Any sort of breach is bad news, of course, but I'm willing to overlook GlobalSign's web server issues entirely. I suspect that many companies wouldn't have turned off part of their business voluntarily, and called in outside help, to investigate allegations of the sort made by ComodoHacker.

  <p>
    In fact, in most of Asia Pacific, where there are no data breach notification requirements at all, you might not hear from a company even if it knew it had suffered a <a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/05/03/sony-admits-breach-larger-than-originally-thought-24-5-million-soe-users-also-affected/">Sony-sized</a> leak of your data, let alone if it had spotted someone fiddling with its web server.

    Hats off to GlobalSign in this matter.
