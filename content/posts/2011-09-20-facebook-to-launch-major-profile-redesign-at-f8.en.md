    Personally I've a feeling facebook is learning too much from Google Plus and its becoming too Google Plus-ish!, As we see they have created new style of lists (give me a feeling like Google Plus circle), redesigned images, new privacy options like Google plus and many more, and now Mashable wrote:

    <i>Here’s what we know so far about the profile redesign:</i>
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>The redesigned profiles will be more “sticky,” says one source. One of the goals of the new profiles is to get users to stay on them for longer.</i>
    </li>

      <i>We already knew <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/31/facebook-music-platform/">Facebook is launching a media platform</a> at f8. However, we’ve also learned that the platform — which will include music and video from partner sites — will display the media content a user is watching or listening to on their profiles. Essentially, when you’re listening to Lady Gaga on Spotify, your friends can see and access that on your Facebook profile. This confirms a recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/business/media/facebook-is-expected-to-unveil-media-sharing-service.html?_r=1" target="_blank">New York Times report</a>.</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>The redesigned profiles are part of a larger push into social ecommerce. We don’t exactly know what that means, but we’ve heard whispers that Facebook intends to give Facebook Credits more prominence. We’ve also heard that a Facebook app store may emerge at f8. </i>
    </li>
    <li>
      <i>Facebook’s push into ecommerce may be related <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/" target="_blank">Project Spartan</a>, an HTML5-based mobile platform rumored to be launching soon.</i>

  </ul>
