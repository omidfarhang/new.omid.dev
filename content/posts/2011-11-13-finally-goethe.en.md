Hey Folks!

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-203" alt="Goethe-Institut" src="/images/2011/11/Goethe-Institut.jpg" width="200" height="94" />](/images/2011/11/Goethe-Institut.jpg)From tomorrow my classes in <a href="http://www.goethe.de/" target="_blank">Goethe Institute</a> will begin, 3 days a week (Sa, Mo, We), from 2:00PM to 3:30PM, I hope I will be finishing that with no problem, seems each level takes 16 weeks and there are 16 level in total, so its gonna take 5 years? ah, that's a long time!, I will be 27 years old!.

Have a good day, folks!
