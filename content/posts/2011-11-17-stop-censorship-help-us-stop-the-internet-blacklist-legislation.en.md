## Protect the Internet

### Help us stop the Internet Blacklist Legislation

[![stop-censorship-small](/images/2011/11/stop-censorship-small.png)](http://www.mozilla.org/sopa/)

Mozilla: On **November 16th**, Congress holds hearings on the first American Internet censorship system. This bill can pass. If it does, the Internet and free speech will never be the same.  
Join us to stop this bill.

#### Why?

A few infringing links are enough to justify censoring an entire site, blocking good content along with the bad.

#### How?

The US will be able to block a site’s web traffic, ad traffic and search traffic using the same website censorship methods used by China, Iran and Syria.

#### Who's at risk?

Your favorite websites both inside and outside the US could be blocked based on an infringement claim.

#### Could this pass?

Yes. The Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act have widespread support in Congress and are expected to pass.
