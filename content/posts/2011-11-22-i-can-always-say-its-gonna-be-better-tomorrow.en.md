_Hey, I'm feeling tired._  
_My time, is gone today._  
_You flirt with suicide._  
_Sometimes, that's ok._  
_Do what others say._  
_I'm here, standing hollow._  
_Falling away from me._  
_Falling away from me._  
_  
_  
_Day, is here fading._  
_That's when, I would say._  
_I flirt with suicide._  
_Sometimes kill the pain._  
_I can always say._  
_&#8216;It's gonna be better tomorrow'._  
_Falling away from me._  
_Falling away from me._
