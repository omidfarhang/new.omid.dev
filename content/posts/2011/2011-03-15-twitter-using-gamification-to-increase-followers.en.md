I just read an interesting post in ThinkVitamin.com and wanted to share with you:

I just signed up for a new Twitter account and as I was going through the on-boarding process, I noticed Twitter has introduced a bit of [Gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) to encourage you to follow more people.

They use a simple progress-bar metaphor to encourage you to follow 10 people. I like it.
