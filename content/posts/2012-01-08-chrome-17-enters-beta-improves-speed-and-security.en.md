    <a href="http://www.h-online.com/security" target="_blank"><b>H-Security</b></a>: Version 17 of <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" rel="external" target="_blank">Chrome</a> has been <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/01/beta-channel-update.html" rel="external" target="_blank">released</a> into the WebKit-based browser's <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/" rel="external" target="_blank">Beta</a> channel. Its developers say that the new Chrome beta, version 17.0.963.26, is focused on improving two of the browser's <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank">core principles</a>: speed and security.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To make Chrome &#8220;go even faster&#8221;, some web pages will start loading in the background before a user has even finished typing a URL into the <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=95440" rel="external" target="_blank">Omnibox</a> address and search bar. To reduce the time between a user pressing enter and the page being fully loaded, Chrome will pre-render some pages if the URL auto-completes to a site a user is likely to visit. According to Google Software Engineer Dominic Hamon, this will, in some cases, cause pages to appear &#8220;instantly&#8221;.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With version 17, Chrome's <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/security.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Safe Browsing</a> technology has been extended to protect against malicious downloads by analysing executable files, including Windows .exe and .msi files. So, if a user visits a web site and is tricked into downloading, for example, a fake anti-virus product, Chrome will issue a warning if the file appears to be malicious and will advise the user to discard it. Further details about Chrome 17.0.963.26, which is available to <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Subscribing-to-a-channel" rel="external" target="_blank">download</a> from dev.chromium.org, can be found in a <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/01/speed-and-security.html" rel="external" target="_blank">post</a> on the Google Chrome Blog.

    The Chrome Team at Google has also updated the browser's Stable channel to version <a href="http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/01/stable-channel-update.html" rel="external" target="_blank">16.0.912.75</a>, closing three <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/severity-guidelines" rel="external" target="_blank">high risk</a> security holes. These include a use-after-free in animation frames, a heap-buffer-overflow in the libxml software library, and a stack-buffer-overflow in glyph handling.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As part of its Chromium Security Rewards programme, Google paid security researchers a total of $2,000 for discovering and reporting the holes. As usual, further details of the vulnerabilities are being withheld until &#8220;a majority of users are up-to-date with the fix&#8221;. Chrome 16.0.912.75 is available to download from <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" rel="external" target="_blank">google.com/chrome</a>; alternatively, users who currently have Chrome installed can use the <a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=95414" rel="external" target="_blank">built-in update function</a>.</div>
