[**H-Security**](http://www.h-online.com/security): Version 17 of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) has been [released](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/01/beta-channel-update.html) into the WebKit-based browser's [Beta](http://www.google.com/landing/chrome/beta/) channel. Its developers say that the new Chrome beta, version 17.0.963.26, is focused on improving two of the browser's [core principles](https://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/index.html): speed and security.

To make Chrome “go even faster”, some web pages will start loading in the background before a user has even finished typing a URL into the [Omnibox](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95440) address and search bar. To reduce the time between a user pressing enter and the page being fully loaded, Chrome will pre-render some pages if the URL auto-completes to a site a user is likely to visit. According to Google Software Engineer Dominic Hamon, this will, in some cases, cause pages to appear “instantly”.

With version 17, Chrome's [Safe Browsing](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/security.html) technology has been extended to protect against malicious downloads by analysing executable files, including Windows .exe and .msi files. So, if a user visits a web site and is tricked into downloading, for example, a fake anti-virus product, Chrome will issue a warning if the file appears to be malicious and will advise the user to discard it. Further details about Chrome 17.0.963.26, which is available to [download](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Subscribing-to-a-channel) from dev.chromium.org, can be found in a [post](http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/01/speed-and-security.html) on the Google Chrome Blog.

The Chrome Team at Google has also updated the browser's Stable channel to version [16.0.912.75](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/01/stable-channel-update.html), closing three [high risk](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/severity-guidelines) security holes. These include a use-after-free in animation frames, a heap-buffer-overflow in the libxml software library, and a stack-buffer-overflow in glyph handling.

As part of its Chromium Security Rewards programme, Google paid security researchers a total of $2,000 for discovering and reporting the holes. As usual, further details of the vulnerabilities are being withheld until “a majority of users are up-to-date with the fix”. Chrome 16.0.912.75 is available to download from [google.com/chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome); alternatively, users who currently have Chrome installed can use the [built-in update function](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95414).
