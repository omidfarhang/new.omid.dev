Have you seen this in your or your friends wall? or maybe in a page you “Like”?

That's another spam link spreading over Facebook, as I already showed you many more in older posts. Usually these links end up either in a phishing attack that theft your private information or infecting your computer.  
If your friend or even a stranger is posting these, don't click on that and also report the post, here is how to do:

But what if your account is posting these links?

1. First of all change your password: [https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account§ion=password](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=account&section=password)
2. Remove every unknown application from your account:  [https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications)

If you use Facebook and want to get an early warning about the latest scares, scams and internet attacks, you should [join the Omid's Network Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/omidsnetwork/).
