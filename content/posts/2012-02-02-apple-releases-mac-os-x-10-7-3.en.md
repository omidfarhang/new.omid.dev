According to Apple, the updates close more than 50 holes, many of which could be exploited by an attacker to, for example, remotely execute arbitrary code on a victim's system, gain access to private information or cause a denial-of-service (DoS). 

The Client and Server updates fix issues in Address Book, ColorSync, CoreAudio, CoreMedia, CoreText, CoreUI, OpenGL, Internet Sharing, ImageIO, and in the QuickTime media player and various libraries used by Mac OS X. Other problems addressed include vulnerabilities in Apache, the [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) reference library, the PHP scripting language, Subversion and X11. Security Update 2012-001 also corrects problems in Tomcat and SquirrelMail. 

Non-security related changes in the 10.7.3 update include a new version of the Safari web browser (5.1.3) and support for additional languages. Issues when using smart cards to log in, in Windows file sharing, and Wi-Fi connection problems when waking from sleep have also been fixed. Support for the camera RAW formats used by [eleven additional digital cameras](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4757) such as the Canon PowerShot S100, Nikon 1 J1 and Sony Alpha NEX-5N has also been added.
