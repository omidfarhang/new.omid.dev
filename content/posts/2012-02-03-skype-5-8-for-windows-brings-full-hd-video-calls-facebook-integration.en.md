Full HD video calls will be most useful to those who own a HD webcam, for example Logitech C920 which does the video encoding itself thus improving HD video quality on older computers. 

Video calling for Facebook works even with users who don’t use Skype. To start a video call with a Facebook buddy, select the person in your list and click “video call.” 

Finally, group screen sharing, available with Skype Premium, allows you to share your screen or an application window with other participants of a conference call. To activate it, choose the + menu during a call and select “share my screen.” 

Other new features include a push to talk hotkey, the ability to hide offline Facebook contacts and Bing Toolbar integration. 

Besides these improvements, the new version fixes several bugs, including the one that prevented you from adding a phone number to a group which belonged to a Facebook contact. You can download it <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype" target="_blank">here</a>.
