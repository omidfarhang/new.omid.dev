Hey People!

Many of you complain (or only think) that I don’t care about you, because I don’t get in touch with you often. Well, you are thinking wrong!

The fact that I don’t call you often is true (Either via phone, messenger, email or social networks), But I’ve a reason for that and its that I never want to be a person that you think why you allowed to become a friend of you, I would rather to be “nothing” rather than “bother”, I will explain it more:

Phone: Why I don’t call you? Its because I don’t know when you are free to do! You may be having a nap, or be driving or be out with your partner or…  
I already call those of you that I know so closely and I know what’s best time to call you.

Messenger: Same above reason, since most of you don’t show it in your status when you are busy, I consider it all of the time that you may be busy, if you have not been most likely you would ping me yourself!![Winking smile](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-EcTelAfx-HA/TzBJZeHGekI/AAAAAAAAEhY/wN7k_gwaCfQ/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800)  
Still I message those of you that I know it won’t bother you!

Email: Well, I do it from time to time, sending a Hi to some of you, yet I would rather keep our calls for somewhere else rather than clutter your inbox, p.s. some of you have multiple email addresses in my contact list, and I don’t know which one to use![Disappointed smile](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-JctYsTQbGEk/TzBJb9ZktaI/AAAAAAAAEhg/Qqtfbq4Yi7w/wlEmoticon-disappointedsmile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800) 

Social Networks (e.g. Facebook): This one is another story, its more public and the reason I don’t post in your pages is that I’m not sure if you like your friends see what I’ve posted to you or not, So I would take care about that, I don’t want you feel bad about my public post to you in front of your friends! (I know of some people that do, that’s why I say this) so I hold my messages etc for our private talk.

Ok, now does it make sense? I hope it will change your mind about me.

All of you always feel free to <a href="/contact-me" target="_blank">contact me</a>, your messages, emails and calls are always welcome and never bother me, so if I don’t ping you often  its not mean I don’t care about you, its mean I care about you and don’t want to bother you in bad time.

Regards!
