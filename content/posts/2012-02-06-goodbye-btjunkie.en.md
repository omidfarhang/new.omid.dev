**gHacks:** Users of the popular Bittorrent indexing website [BTJunkie](http://btjunkie.org/goodbye.html) who try to access the site’s content in a web browser are not seeing the usual site layout, but a goodbye message instead. The message states that the site operators have decided to close down the service voluntarily after more than seven years of operation. 

No reason other than that is provided, but it is likely that the decision is linked to recent events, in particular the Pirate Bay case in Sweden where founders of the site recently lost the final appeal and are looking at prison time, and the Megaupload takedown and the fallout that followed. 

The announcement on the BTJunkie website reads: 

> <tt>This is the end of the line my friends. The decision does not come easy, but we’ve decided to voluntarily shut down. We’ve been fighting for years for your right to communicate, but it’s time to move on. It’s been an experience of a lifetime, we wish you all the best!</tt>

BTJunkie, according to [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/btjunkie.org) web statistics, was one of the top 400 Internet websites that was visited by millions of visitors per month. Much of the appeal of the site came from the fact that all of the site’s contents were publicly accessible. 

It is likely that uses, after a moment of grieving, will move on to other popular Bttorrent sites like The Pirate Bay and Kat.ph, or private Bittorrent sites that require an invitation to get access to the site’s contents. 

BTJunkie users who feel lost right now should check out the threads over at [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pcjru/btjunkie_2005_2012_rip/) and [Torrentfreak](http://torrentfreak.com/btjunkie-shuts-down-for-good-120206/) for a list of alternative sites.
