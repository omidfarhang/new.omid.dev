Blind SQL injection is identical to normal SQL Injection except that when an attacker attempts to exploit an application rather then getting a useful error message they get a generic page specified by the developer instead. This makes exploiting a potential SQL Injection attack more difficult but not impossible. An attacker can still steal data by asking a series of True and False questions through sql statements. 

Information purported to be stolen from the organization was posted on the site [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/ZB4eLVeS) on Thursday morning. **Martin Nesirky**, a spokesperson for the Secretary General of the United Nations, confirmed the breach.”_A case of unauthorized access to the UN website is still being investigated_,” Nesirky said in a statement. “_Whoever sought access was able to read some data from databases but was not able to modify content and was not able to prevent public access to the website._”
