The problems affect Shockwave Player 11.6.3.633 and all earlier versions on Windows and Mac OS X – Adobe recommend updating to the new release by downloading it from [get.adobe.com/shockwave](http://get.adobe.com/shockwave/). To identify whether Shockwave Player is installed on a system, users should visit the [test page](http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/) on Adobe's site. 

The majority of the problems are in the Shockwave 3D Asset where seven memory corruption vulnerabilities could lead to code execution; these were all reported by Hongnang Ren of FortiGuard Labs. An eighth memory corruption issue and a heap overflow vulnerability, both of which could also lead to code execution, were reported by “instruder” of vulnhunt.com and bring the flaw tally up to nine.
