By using HTTPS, all user information including log-in credentials transmitted to the company's servers are sent using SSL encryption. This means that all data is transmitted in encrypted form and can no longer be read and exploited for fraudulent activities by attackers using tools such as the Firesheep extension for Firefox. 

The company originally added the “Always use HTTPS” option in March of last year but required users to manually enable it. Later, in August, it began to enable the setting by default for “some” of its users. Those who prefer not to use HTTPS can still disable it by unchecking the “Always use HTTPS” setting on the [Account Settings page](https://twitter.com/settings/account). More details about HTTPS on Twitter and keeping an account secure can be found in the [Twitter Help Center](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76036-safety-keeping-your-account-secure).
