For instance, messages have been seen shared on Facebook claiming to link to a video of Whitney Houston's autopsy. 

According to the messages, the video of Whitney Houston's autopsy &#8220;reveals a shocking secret that explains her death&#8221;. 

Here's what a typical message looks like:

Clicking on the link will take your browser which appears to show a YouTube video embedded on what looks like a Facebook webpage. However, a message on the page says that the video cannot be played as your version of Adobe Flash needs to be updated.

Of course, you should only ever download an update for your installation of Flash from the \*real\* Adobe website, so my recommendation would be very wary about downloading any software that this bogus webpage might serve up to you, or any scam survey pages that it might direct you towards.
