It was abysmal and improving that experience should be a top priority for that team if they care about expanding LibreOffice beyond the few Linux users who get it pre-installed. But, I do think I could have done more to propose fixes rather than just rant about the brokenness of the experience so I've done just that. 

I read through almost all of the LibreOffice bugs relating to the website, the installer, and the java dependencies and I've filed new bugs where appropriate and added comments to existing bugs as well. If you'd like to follow along, here are the bug reports.
