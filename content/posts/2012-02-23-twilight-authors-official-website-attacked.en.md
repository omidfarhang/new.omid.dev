It might be something supernatural, but not in the security world: **_[zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(computer_science))_**. 

Our friends at <a href="https://blog.avast.com/2012/02/23/twilight-authors-official-website-attacked/" target="_blank">avast!</a> have unearthed a recent attack on the author’s website not so long ago:_www.stepheniemeyer.com_ had been hosting **Crimepack**, an exploit kit that takes advantage of known vulnerabilities of various Web browsers and the Windows OS to install malware. Brian Krebs of_KrebsOnSecurity.com_ [took a closer look](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/08/crimepack-packed-with-hard-lessons/) at this particular exploit pack back in 2010, and it is indeed a nasty one. Not only is it capable of targeting holes of software installed on your system, it also “lets customers [buyers of this Crimepack exploit kit] test various Web reputation services to discover whether any include their exploit sites.” Computers successfully exploited by the Crimepack exploit kit are eventually turned into zombies, which online criminals use to do malicious tasks, such as spamming and launching **denial of service (DoS)** attacks. 

_www.stepheniemeyer.com_ is now free from malicious codes. 

Once again, we implore our readers to make it a point to regularly update their operating system and security software. 

Stay safe!
