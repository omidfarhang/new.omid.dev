Oops indeed. At least if you were one of the Facebook users who believed that a hidden camera video had leaked onto the net of Justin Bieber sharing some intimate moments with his girlfriend Selena Gomez. 

Of course, Bieber's typical fans &#8211; or those who would delight in his public humiliation by a hungry paparazzi &#8211; are probably unlikely to think twice about clicking on a link shared with them by their Facebook friends, claiming to leak to a sex video.

> <tt>00ps!!! There was a hidden camera in Selena & bieber's bedroom</tt>  
> <tt>[LINK]</tt>  
> <tt>WOW HaHa it's really so funny ~ Don't Miss it!</tt>

If you made the mistake of clicking on the link, you would be taken to a third-party website which urges you to share the video further, amongst your Facebook friends.

And if you made the mistake of sharing you'll then be presented with an all-too-familiar online survey. This is how the scammers make money, tricking you into driving traffic to online surveys that earn them commission. Using <a href="/2012/02/ex-girlfriend-sex-videos-browser.html" target="_blank">sex videos</a> is not a new technique, and Justin Bieber has had his name used in vain by the scammers on several occasions. 

If you were fooled into participating in this scam remove the message from your newsfeed, and delete any messages you may have inadvertently shared with your friends. That way at least you are no longer spreading it with your online chums. You can also report the link as spam &#8211; hopefully if enough people do it, Facebook will begin to stop the scam from spreading.
