Paul K Martin said hackers took over Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) computers and &#8220;compromised the accounts of the most privileged JPL users&#8221;. 

He said the attack, involving Chinese IP addresses, was under investigation. 

In a statement, Nasa said it had &#8220;made significant progress to protect the agency's IT systems&#8221;. 

Mr Martin's [testimony on Nasa's cybersecurity](http://oig.nasa.gov/congressional/FINAL_written_statement_for_%20IT_%20hearing_February_26_edit_v2.pdf) was submitted to the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology's Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight. 

**State of security** 

In the document, he outlined how investigators believed the attack had involved &#8220;Chinese-based internet protocol [IP] addresses&#8221;. 

He said that the attackers had &#8220;full system access&#8221; and would have been able to &#8220;modify, copy, or delete sensitive files&#8221; or &#8220;upload hacking tools to steal user credentials and compromise other Nasa systems&#8221;. 

Mr Martin outlined how the agency suffered &#8220;5,408 computer security incidents&#8221; between 2010 and 2011. 

He also noted that &#8220;between April 2009 and April 2011, Nasa reported the loss or theft of 48 Agency mobile computing devices&#8221;. 

In one incident an unencrypted notebook computer was lost containing details of the algorithms &#8211; the mathematical models &#8211; used to control the International Space Station. 

Nasa told the BBC that &#8220;at no point in time have operations of the International Space Station been in jeopardy due to a data breach&#8221;. 

**Mixed motives** 

Mr Martin said Nasa was a &#8220;target-rich environment for cyber attacks&#8221;. 

He said that the motivation of the hackers ranged from &#8220;individuals testing their skill to break into Nasa systems, to well-organized criminal enterprises hacking for profit, to intrusions that may have been sponsored by foreign intelligence services&#8221;. 

But while Mr Martin criticised aspects of Nasa's cybersecurity he noted investigations had resulted in &#8220;arrests and convictions of foreign nationals in China, Great Britain, Italy, Nigeria, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, and Estonia&#8221;. 

Nasa said it was working to implement the security improvements Mr Martin suggested in his testimony. 

However the chairman of the congressional subcommittee, Rep Paul Broun, [quoted in an online report of proceedings,](http://science.house.gov/press-release/witnesses-highlight-unique-cybersecurity-challenges-nasa) said: &#8220;Despite this progress, the threat to Nasa's information security is persistent, and ever changing. Unless Nasa is able to constantly adapt &#8211; their data, systems, and operations will continue to be endangered.&#8221;
