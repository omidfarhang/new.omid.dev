Hi People!

I need your help for restoring my PayPal account, as of Jan 2011 PayPal has limited my account and asking me verify some stuff which right now I cannot, Do you have any idea what I can do for this?

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-180" alt="AccountLimited" src="/images/2012/03/AccountLimited.jpg" width="500" height="341" srcset="/images/sites/2/2012/03/AccountLimited.jpg 500w, /images/sites/2/2012/03/AccountLimited-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />](/images/2012/03/AccountLimited.jpg)

As you see in the image, its asking me for a Photo ID and proof of address, Since I live somewhere of world that is affected by US Embargo law either of documents I send to them will be rejected and also result in blocking my account, so, Does any of you have an idea what I can do for this? every single idea from you will be welcome, share your ideas in the comments blow or send them to me via “<a href="/contact-me" target="_blank">Contact Me</a>” link above this page.
