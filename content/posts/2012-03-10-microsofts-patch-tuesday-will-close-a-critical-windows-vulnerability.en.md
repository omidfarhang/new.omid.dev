The rating means that the hole enables attackers to infect a system via the internet and inject malicious code. Other bulletins will address a privilege elevation flaw which affects the same span of Windows versions. 

Microsoft also plans to close an important denial of service vulnerability in Windows Server 2003 SP2, 2008 SP2 and 2008 R2. Another bulletin will address a “moderate” denial of service bug which affects Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Windows developers will find that an elevation of privilege flaw in Visual Studio 2008 and 2010 is also addressed. All versions of another development tool, Microsoft Expression Design, will also receive a fix for an important remote code execution flaw in the application.
