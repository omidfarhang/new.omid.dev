Last month has been a good one for me, I could get some new toys for myself and that’s good, I’ve not completed my todo list (or shopping list), but some important one is done.

Here is some of them:

  * A new phone: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Wildfire_S" target="_blank">HTC Wildfire S</a>, I like it, not a very powerful one but its doing the job I need, let me access my messenger and emails and also have my dropbox and evernote with myself.
  * A new multifunction printer: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/HP-Officejet-Wireless-CN547A-B1H/dp/B0036TGGJG" target="_blank">HP OfficeJet 4500 Wireless</a>, it looks good, not a speedy printer or professional quality prints, but it connects wirelessly to my router and everyone at home can use it for scan/print/copy or fax.
  * A new external DVD-writer: Not best choice I had, but I did, a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-SE-208AB-Portable-External-Writer/dp/B005N2UE2O" target="_blank">portable Samsung DVD-Writer</a>, I think a non-portable could be a better choice, but now I’ve bought it and gonna see how it works!
  * A new USB Hub: <a href="http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=149" target="_blank">D-Link 7-Port USB Hub</a>, really these days 4 USB port is not enough and this one has been something essential for me, now I can connect all my stuff in same time! (music player, external hard drive, external DVD-RW, phone etc)

Yeah, those are some of the my new toys, but in the future I will be looking for a new monitor, an external sound card and some other gadgets, Do you have any suggestion which model and brand is best? Let me know!

Have fun guys!
