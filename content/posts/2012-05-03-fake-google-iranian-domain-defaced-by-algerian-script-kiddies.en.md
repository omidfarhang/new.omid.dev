<a href="http://thehackernews.com/2012/05/google-iraq-defaced-by-anonymous.html" target="_blank">TheHackerNews</a>: Google got Pwned ? NO Few **Algerian Script Kiddies** try to spread fake rumors that they Hack and Deface the Giant Search engine &#8220;**Google Iranian**&#8221; domain <http://www.google.co.ir/> . As the screenshot shown a Algerian flag on it and Page Titles : **&#8220;****H4Ck3D By vaga-hacker dz and DR.KIM&#8221;.**

As mentioned by hacker, the team include hackers named : &#8220;**V4Ga-Dz,Dz0ne,DR-KIM King-Dz,BroX0 aghilass elite jrojan password kha&mix wasim -dz**&#8221; . It is not confirmed that, either these are member from some Anonymous Hackers but they try to use Anonymous Hackers Tag line : We Dont Forget , We Dont Forgive, **Expect Us!** to get some publicity.

According to further investigation by &#8220;**The Hacker News**&#8221; Technical Team, we found that &#8220;**google.co.ir**&#8221; possibly not belongs to GOOGLE because site rank is &#8220;[3141379](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http://google.co.ir)&#8221;Â  , that means the site should have less than 100 Visitors/Day approx. Also we check [WHO.IS](http://who.is/whois/google.co.ir/) records of this domain and found that Domain Holder is &#8220;**Ganjineh ofogh omid gostar laleh eshragh**&#8221; which is registered using a Google mail &#8220;sellinform110@gmail.com&#8221; and Phone No. is : 09377705008 .
