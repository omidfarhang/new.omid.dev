  Hi,<br />You may have noticed that part of my blog posts are copied from other source as I name them (and link them) in beginning of my posts, for example “<a href="http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/" target="_blank">Naked Security</a>” (SophosLabs).</p> 
  
  <p>
    Just today <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/102593062779602837630/posts/AdqugREaN8G" target="_blank">I noticed a message</a> from “Graham Cluley”, one of the Authors in “Naked Security” blog which asked me to don’t re-post his articles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the past I had checked with many of my other sources and they have always gave me permission to share their articles as long as it comes with a link to the source too and I thought “Naked Security” blog follow same rule, but seems they don’t, no problem.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyway I heard your message, Mr. Cluley and next time I will just link to your post directly, hope it will have some more good for you!
  </p>
