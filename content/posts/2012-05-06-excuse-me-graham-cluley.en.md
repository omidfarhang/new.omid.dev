 Hi,/
 You may have noticed that part of my blog posts are copied from other source as I name them (and link them) in beginning of my posts, for example “[Naked Security](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/)” (SophosLabs).
  
Just today [I noticed a message](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102593062779602837630/posts/AdqugREaN8G) from “Graham Cluley”, one of the Authors in “Naked Security” blog which asked me to don’t re-post his articles.

In the past I had checked with many of my other sources and they have always gave me permission to share their articles as long as it comes with a link to the source too and I thought “Naked Security” blog follow same rule, but seems they don’t, no problem.

Anyway I heard your message, Mr. Cluley and next time I will just link to your post directly, hope it will have some more good for you!

Best Regards\
