Google's Knowledge Graph will display summaries of topics when your query is related to one of the 500 million items in Google's new database of things.

Google has long sought to index the world's information — and it's now taking things a step farther with an effort to create “a database of everything in the world.” And it's bringing this effort to your search results pages. 

The new Knowledge Graph project, rolling out to English-language Google Search users over the next few days, provides more data snippets alongside its query results than the search engine currently provides. The results are based on Google's new database of 500 million people, places, and things, says Jack Manzel, Product Management Director of Search at Google. Manzel says there are 3.5 billion attributes and connections between these things in the database. 

You'll be able to meander through lists of facts and connections when you are searching for items that are in the Knowledge Graph. As one Google example illustrates, if you search for Frank Lloyd Wright, you'll get a fact box with a summary about him (from Wikipedia), a small collection of biographical facts, and picture links to the buildings he designed. If you click on Fallingwater, you'll get another fact box about that house. 

Google has both personnel and technology to curate what results appear in these fact boxes.
