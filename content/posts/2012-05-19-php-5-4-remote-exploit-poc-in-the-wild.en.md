ISC Diary: 

There is a remote exploit in the wild for PHP 5.4.3 in Windows, which takes advantage of a vulnerability in the [com\_print\_typeinfo](http://php.net/manual/en/function.com-print-typeinfo.php) function. The php engine needs to execute the malicious code, which can include any shellcode like the the ones that bind a shell to a port. 

Since there is no patch available for this vulnerability yet, you might want to do the following: 

  * Block any file upload function in your php applications to avoid risks of exploit code execution. 
  * Use your IPS to filter known shellcodes like the ones included in metasploit. 
  * Keep PHP in the current available version, so you can know that you are not a possible target for any other vulnerability like [CVE-2012-2336](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2336) registered at the beginning of the month. 
  * Use your HIPS to block any possible buffer overflow in your system.
