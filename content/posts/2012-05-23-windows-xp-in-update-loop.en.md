Three security updates for .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.5 are at the center of the problem, labeled as patches [KB2518664](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2518864), [KB2572073](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2572073) and [KB2633880](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2633880) in Windows XP's automatic update feature. 

On affected systems, the installation of these patches proceeds without error but after a short time, the update service says it would like to install them again and will keep reinstalling the patches if allowed. Microsoft's general advice in this situation is to [reset Windows Update components](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910339), though it has yet to offer any specific advice. It is interesting to note that the three patches in question were not released on Microsoft's official patch day.
