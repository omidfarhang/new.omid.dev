> _AVAST Software a.s. is currently blocking access to port 80 (that effectively means websites and updates of avast! software) of its servers from following countries: Iran, Sudan, Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Burma/Myanmar. AVAST Software a.s. [and its subsidiaries/sister companies] must not provide any services in these countries because of policies and regulations that are applicable to AVAST Software a.s._
> 
> _Blog and forum are available, because we hope they are information source/personal communication service and because of this they have exclusion from these regulations._
> 
> _We are sorry for any caused inconvenience._
