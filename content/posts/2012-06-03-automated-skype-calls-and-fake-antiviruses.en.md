This is an old story back from September, 2011, but since recently I’ve seen users complaining about this, I want to share it again [Credit to [NakedSecurity](http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/09/19/automated-skype-calls-spread-fake-anti-virus-warning-video), SophoLabs]:

You may have received an automated call from a user who claim to be from Skype or somewhere which says:

> Attention: this is an automated computer system alert. Your computer protection service is not active. To activate computer protection, and repair your computer, go to [LINK]

Indeed that’s a scam and visiting the link will lead to getting infected by Fake Antivirus (Scareware), the website claims that you are not properly protected &#8211; and it urges you to install its software (a steal at $19.95).

To stop such calls in the future you can set your privacy options to only allow calls from your contacts:

Here is a video that show an example of these calls:
