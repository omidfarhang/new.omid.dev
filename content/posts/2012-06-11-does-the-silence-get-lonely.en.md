Well I wish there was someone  
Well I wish there was someone  
To love me

When I used to be someone  
And I knew there was someone  
That loved me

As I sit here frozen alone  
Even ghosts get tired and go home  
As they crawl back under the stones

And I wish there was something  
Please tell me there's something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness

And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can  
it's just saturated loneliness

Does the silence get lonely?  
Does the silence get lonely?  
Who knows?  
I've been hearing it tell me  
I've been hearing it tell me  
Go home

Cause the freaks are playing tonight  
They packed up and turned out the lights

And I wish there was something  
Please tell me there's something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness

And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can  
It's just saturated loneliness

And the bath waters cold  
And this life's getting old

And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it, corrupt it  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
And I wish I could feel it  
Abduct it, corrupt it  
But I never can  
I never can  
Never Can  
Never Can  
Never Can
