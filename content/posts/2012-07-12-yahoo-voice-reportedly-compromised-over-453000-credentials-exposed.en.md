Earlier today, more than 453,000 user accounts from an unidentified service owned by Yahoo were posted on a hacker site. The hackers reportedly said that they infiltrated the subdomain by using a union-based [SQL injection](http://hakipedia.com/index.php/SQL_Injection). But the group responsible for the security breach added that the data breach was intended to be a wake-up call for Yahoo. 

“We hope that the parties responsible for managing the security of this subdomain will take this as a wake-up call, and not as a threat,” the hackers wrote. “There have been many security holes exploited in webservers belonging to Yahoo! Inc. that have caused far greater damage than our disclosure. Please do not take them lightly. The subdomain and vulnerable parameters have not been posted to avoid further damage.” According to [TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com/july-2012/yahoo-voice-website-breached-400000-compromised/), the compromised server could most likely belong to Yahoo! Voice. This assumption was based on the string “dbb1.ac.bf1.yahoo.com” found in the data dump. Yahoo has yet to release an official response to the reports. 

If you have a Yahoo account you should change your password as soon as possible.
