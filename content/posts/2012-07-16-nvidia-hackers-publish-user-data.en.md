A hacker group calling itself “Team Apollo” has now claimed responsibility for the breach which caused NVIDIA to take the site down. 

As proof, they have [published](http://pastebin.com/G21ytATD) email addresses and password hashes for approximately 800 users from the database on Pastebin, with more, apparently, to follow. If the data proves to be genuine, NVIDIA's [statement](http://www.nvidia.com/content/forums/index.html) that the password hashes were salted would be contradicted: the database excerpt includes the hash `b018f55f348b0959333be092ba0b1f41` three times in the list, the result of `md5('nvidia123')`. 

In addition, the hackers have stated that [NVIDIA's online store](http://www.nvidia.com/content/store/index.html) was also broken into, which NVIDIA did not mention to **The H'**s associates at heise Security. The hacker group said that the break-in occurred “a few weeks ago”. The group apparently copied the data to “target disgusting corporations who deserve to be brought to justice” – although they have not specified which corporations are being targeted or what form this “justice” will take.
