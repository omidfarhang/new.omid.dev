The company recommends that users install the security updates immediately. Versions 5 to 7 of the Windows, Mac OS X and Linux editions of TeamViewer Full and TeamViewer QuickSupport are affected. The flaw does not appear to have been discovered in TeamViewer Host. 

The company has not offered any details of the vulnerability, but updated editions of the software can be obtained from the [TeamViewer Download](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/index.aspx) page. The new version can simply be installed over the previous installation.
