This news comes a day after it was announced that the [final version of Windows 8 had been finished](http://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/08/microsoft-windows-8-it-is-finished/). MSDN and TechNet customers won’t be able to download their version of Windows 8 until August 15th, an enterprise version of Windows 8 is currently making rounds at different file sharing websites across the web.

Unfortunately, if you were hoping for the Windows Media Player to be included in this version, you’re out of luck as it is the “N” version of Windows 8 which doesn’t come with the Player. Microsoft was forced to create a “N” build of its operating system as the European Commission ruled in 2004 that they need to create a version of Windows OS without the Windows Media Player included. Microsoft has yet to release a comment on the situation yet. Consumers will be able to get their hands on Windows 8 officially starting October 26th. We’ll keep you updated on the situation as more info becomes available and let us know in the comments section below if you plan on downloading the leaked build of Windows 8.
