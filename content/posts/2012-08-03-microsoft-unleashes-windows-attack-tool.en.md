That may well be a refrain that motivated Redmond to release a new software tool, Surface Analyzer 1.0, which explains how new apps impact Windows’ ability to repel the various varieties of naughtyware. 

Microsoft explains the tool’s powers thusly: 

> Attack Surface Analyzer looks for classes of security weaknesses Microsoft has seen when applications are installed on the Windows operating system, and it highlights these as issues. The tool also gives an overview of changes to the system that Microsoft considers important to the security of the platform, and it highlights these changes in the attack surface report. Some of the checks performed by the tool include analysis of changed or newly added files, registry keys, services, Microsoft ActiveX controls, listening ports and other parameters that affect a computer's attack surface.

Redmond expects developers will find the new application useful to fine tune their wares before imposing new worries on real, live, end-users. IT departments are also expected to find the tool useful. 

The new version of Attack Surface Analyzer is a full 1.0 release, taking the tool out of beta. You can grab it [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sdl/archive/2012/08/02/attack-surface-analyzer-1-0-released.aspx).
