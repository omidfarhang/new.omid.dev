The fake &#8220;AntiHacker&#8221; tool is being spread through targeted phishing emails and via sites such as Facebook, and claims to provide &#8220;Auto-Protect & Auto-Detect & Security & Quick scan and analyzing&#8221; functionality. 

However, according to the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) (EFF), the fraudulent tool actually installs a program called DarkComet RAT (remote access tool). The US digital rights advocacy organization says that the new malware is being spread and controlled by pro-government hackers. With DarkComet, these hackers can remotely access users' systems to steal private data, record keystrokes, disable certain antivirus programs' notification systems and even obtain images from a computer's built-in webcam. 

Users who believe their systems are infected with the remote access program can download the [DarkComet RAT removal tool](http://www.phrozensoft.com/dcrem.more) by developer Jean-Pierre Lesueur, who originally wrote DarkComet. Lesueur [stopped development and sales](http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/darkcomet-rat-flames-out-070912) of DarkComet after he learned that it was being used by Syrian government forces against political opponents.
