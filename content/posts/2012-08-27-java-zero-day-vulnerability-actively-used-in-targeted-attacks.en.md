<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/java-zero-day-vulnerability-actively-used-in-targeted-attacks-7000003233/" target="_blank"><img title="Java" border="0" alt="Java" align="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Z71qqXKB38g/UDvIjUWvYyI/AAAAAAAAHPQ/S_hkki2ZjnU/Java%25255B9%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="175" height="300" />ZDNet</a>: Security researchers from [FireEye](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2012/08/zero-day-season-is-not-over-yet.html), [AlienVault](http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/new-java-0day-exploited-in-the-wild/), and [DeependResearch](http://www.deependresearch.org/2012/08/java-7-0-day-vulnerability-information.html) have intercepted targeted malware attacks utilizing the latest Java zero day exploit. The vulnerability affects Java 7 (1.7) Update 0 to 6. It does not affect Java 6 and below. 

Based on [related reports](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2012/08/27/lets-start-the-week-with-a-new-java-0day), researchers were able to reproduce the exploit on Windows 7 SP1 with Java 7 Update 6. There's also [a Metasploit module](https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2012/08/27/lets-start-the-week-with-a-new-java-0day) available. 

Upon successful exploitation, the campaign drops [MD5: 4a55bf1448262bf71707eef7fc168f7d](https://www.virustotal.com/file/09d10ae0f763e91982e1c276aad0b26a575840ad986b8f53553a4ea0a948200f/analysis/1346055031/) â€“ detected by 28 out of 42 antivirus scanners as Gen:Trojan.Heur.FU.bqW@a4uT4@bb; Backdoor:Win32/Poison.E 

Users are advised to consider browsing the Web, and interacting with emails in an [isolated environment](http://sandboxie.com/), or to to block Java in their Web browsers until Oracle ships a patch for the security flaw. 

Although what we've got here is a clear indication of an ongoing malicious attack utilizing a zero day flaw, on the majority of occasions cybercriminals wouldn't necessarily rely on a zero day flaw in order to infect as many users as possible. Instead, they would stick to using outdated and already patched vulnerabilities taking into consideration the fact that end and corporate users aren't [patching their third-party software](http://secunia.com/products/consumer/psi/) and [browser plugins](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/plugincheck/).
