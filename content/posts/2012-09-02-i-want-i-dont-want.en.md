I never could understand those people that afraid everything and everyone, why people don’t live in a normal and easy world? Why take it so hard? 

I’m talking of the moment when I respect a boy and he behaves defensive because he thinks I’m looking for his money… 

I’m talking of the moment when I respect a man and he behaves defensive because he thinks I’m looking to use his position… 

I’m talking of the moment when I respect a girl and he thinks I’m looking for her body… 

No, Dear world! Dear folks! People are not same! Dear young man, if one tried to use your money it does not mean your next friend is same, dear gentleman! if one tried to use your position it’s not mean everyone in the world is like that, Dear girl, I don’t blame you for being careful but if one or two or maybe more if you are pretty one only tried to reach to your body by calling themselves your friend, it does not mean every single ‘male’ human is same. 

I talk of myself, I’m an easy person, and all that I expect in a friendship is ‘trust’, me trusting you and you trusting me, that way I’m happy, <a href="/2011/11/i-realized-some-of-my-thoughts.html" target="_blank">as I said before</a>, I don’t expect much from my friends so I’m way more happy that way. Maybe my close friends have noticed that I even rejected their volunteer helps to me, because I wanted them to stay my friends and don’t let ‘giving service’ to each other affect our friendship, to don’t let them think if I’m their friend for their money or their support or their body or whatever, I only want their friendship, their trust. 

It really hurts when I feel I’ve been ignored or not being trusted, even in a situation like when someone needed help and did not ‘trust’ me ask for help, or when they wanted to talk about a very common every day stuff and did not ‘trust’ me for understanding them!; Maybe I should be happy saying Thanks God they did not bother me but no! I don’t think that way. 

Open your eyes, this world is too dirty, but not all spot of it.
