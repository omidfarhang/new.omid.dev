As a move to back up such a claim, the AntiSec hacker group is said to have released slightly more than a million Apple Device IDs to the masses. This particular expose was unveiled on [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/nfVT7b0Z), which is said to hold a detailed description of the method that the hacking group were said to have obtained the IDs from the FBI. 

AntiSec claims, “During the second week of March 2012, a Dell Vostro notebook, used by Supervisor Special Agent Christopher K. Stangl from FBI Regional Cyber Action Team and New York FBI Office Evidence Response Team was breached using the AtomicReferenceArray vulnerability on Java, during the shell session some files were downloaded from his Desktop folder one of them with the name of “NCFTA\_iOS\_devices_intel.csv” turned to be a list of 12,367,232 Apple iOS devices including Unique Device Identifiers (UDID), user names, name of device, type of device, Apple Push Notification Service tokens, zipcodes, cellphone numbers, addresses, etc.” 

Just a little bit of background information here, Apple Unique Device Identifiers (UDID) are actually sequences which comprise of 40 letters and numbers that are unique to each Apple device. Alone, they do not tell much, but in obtaining them, hackers can also gain access to majority of the information which most iOS app developers are able to obtain. Do you think this alleged Device ID leak is true?
