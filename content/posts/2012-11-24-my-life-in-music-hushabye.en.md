This is how I go to bed, dreaming before I sleep.

{{< youtube L2lpQUQrOU8 >}}

This sunny Sunday\
Is a good day to go\
Guess you want me to stay\
Well then let me know\
And I hate to say\
It's been a waste of time\
I hate to interrupt the flow

Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?\
Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

You say you'd love to\
But you've lots left to do\
Almost decided to stay 'cause of you\
And I hate to tell you to exchange your dreams\
For a one-way ticket, no return

Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?\
Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Why, why\
What you hanging up for?\
What you doing that for?\
What you breaking up for?\
Why, hushabye

I hate to interrupt the flow\
For a one way ticket, no return

This sunny Sunday is a good day to go

Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?\
Why, Why, Why\
Hushabye\
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Hushabye\
Why, why, why I\
What you breaking up for?\
Why\
Hushabye

We've wasted it, our time is up
