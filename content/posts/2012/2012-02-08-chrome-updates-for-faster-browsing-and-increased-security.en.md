Chrome 17 (17.0.963.46) pre-renders pages in the background when you type in the URL in the omnibox address bar so the site will appear to come up almost instantaneously. Chrome also now scans download executable-s (e.g., “.exe” and “.msi” files) and warns you if it thinks the file is malicious. 

For more information on the new release, you can check out the Google Chrome blog. Otherwise, just update to the latest version from within your Chrome browser or [download Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) and enjoy a speedier web experience. 

Complete Changelog is available in Chrome Release Blog: <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/02/stable-channel-update.html>
