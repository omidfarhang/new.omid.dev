[TheHackerNews](http://thehackernews.com/2012/05/google-iraq-defaced-by-anonymous.html): Google got Pwned ? NO Few **Algerian Script Kiddies** try to spread fake rumors that they Hack and Deface the Giant Search engine “**Google Iranian**” domain <http://www.google.co.ir/> . As the screenshot shown a Algerian flag on it and Page Titles : **“****H4Ck3D By vaga-hacker dz and DR.KIM”.**

As mentioned by hacker, the team include hackers named : “**V4Ga-Dz,Dz0ne,DR-KIM King-Dz,BroX0 aghilass elite jrojan password kha&mix wasim -dz**” . It is not confirmed that, either these are member from some Anonymous Hackers but they try to use Anonymous Hackers Tag line : We Dont Forget , We Dont Forgive, **Expect Us!** to get some publicity.

According to further investigation by “**The Hacker News**” Technical Team, we found that “**google.co.ir**” possibly not belongs to GOOGLE because site rank is “[3141379](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/http://google.co.ir)”  , that means the site should have less than 100 Visitors/Day approx. Also we check [WHO.IS](http://who.is/whois/google.co.ir/) records of this domain and found that Domain Holder is “**Ganjineh ofogh omid gostar laleh eshragh**” which is registered using a Google mail “sellinform110@gmail.com” and Phone No. is : 09377705008 .

May be some Readers are thinking that Hacking a Google domain is not possible, so here we have something for you from past, last year Google Bangladesh website ([Google.com.bd](http://google.com.bd/)) was also [Hacked by TiGER-M@TE](http://thehackernews.com/2011/01/google-bangladesh-website-googlecombd.html) using DNS hijacking method.
