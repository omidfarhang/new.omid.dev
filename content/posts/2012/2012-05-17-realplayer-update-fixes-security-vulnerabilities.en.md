The released update, version 15.0.4.53 of RealPlayer, closes three security holes. One hole is related to ASM RuleBook parsing that could be exploited by an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code, another is a memory corruption problem related to MP4 file handling in the QuickTime plugin used by RealPlayer, and the third is a buffer overrun in the Media parser. 

RealPlayer Versions 11.0 to 11.1 and 14.0.0 to 15.0.3.37, as well as RealPlayer SP 1.0 to 1.1.5 are affected; RealPlayer for Mac is not vulnerable. RealPlayer 15.0.4.53 – available for Windows 7, Vista SP1 and XP SP3 – corrects these problems. All users are advised to upgrade to the latest version. An alternative option is to simply uninstall RealPlayer as very few sites use it exclusively.
