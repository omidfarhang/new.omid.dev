**TheTelegraph: Internet Explorer users might want to consider upgrading or switching to another browser after a massive security hole was discovered in Windows' native web browser.**

The forum claimed the exploit would give cyber criminals “the same privileges as the current user”. 

It claimed that 41 per cent of US and 32 per cent of global Internet Explorer users could be affected. 

Microsoft confirmed that it was aware of the targeted attacks “potentially affecting some versions of Internet Explorer”. 

Director of Microsoft Trustworthy Computer, Yunsun Wee, told Fairfax that Internet Explorer 10 is not affected by the issue. 

“We recommend customers deploy <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29851" target="_blank">Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit 3.0</a>, which provides effective protections without affecting the web browsing experience,” he said. “We will continue to investigate this issue and take further actions as appropriate.”
