For starters, it has added an improved PDF viewer, which lets you navigate to any page in the document by tapping on the thumbnail. It’s rather awesome, in fact. The update also introduces push notifications for folders shared with you – a feature that’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android&#038;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kcm9wYm94LmFuZHJvaWQiXQ" target="_blank">now available on Android</a>, too.

An interesting side note on this – Dropbox is actually using a paid, third party component called <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/" target="_blank">PSPDFKit</a> for the viewer. Dropbox’s Stephen Poletto <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenpoletto" target="_blank">shared this news on Twitter earlier today.</a> 

Another new addition which will again appeal to professionals on the service, is the ability to now sort files by the date they were modified – that’s handy for those using shared folders as they collaborate on files that are under revision. 

A small thing, perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, but one that’s going to make life easier on a large number of users. 

It’s also shows that Dropbox is thinking about the kind of things its business users need. The little pain points that, when combined, can add up to an overall poor experience. 

The push notifications option will alert users when someone shares a folder with them. This feature will be handy for both consumers and enterprise alike. While it’s new to Android and iOS, the PDF viewer has not yet made its way to Android at this time. That should change soon, though, as Dropbox tries to keep its platform releases relatively close together. 

The updated app is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id327630330" target="_blank">here</a> on iTunes, and the Android version is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwiY29tLmRyb3Bib3guYW5kcm9pZCJd" target="_blank">here</a>.
