Hey Folks

Iâ€™m back with some new toys to listen music even better, here we go:

## Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro USB Sound Card

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-129" alt="510pghGBGxL[7]" src="/images/2013/03/510pghGBGxL7-300x159.jpg" width="300" height="159" srcset="/images/sites/2/2013/03/510pghGBGxL7-300x159.jpg 300w, /images/sites/2/2013/03/510pghGBGxL7.jpg 468w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/images/2013/03/510pghGBGxL7.jpg) [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-130" alt="fea4_zoom[4]" src="/images/2013/03/fea4_zoom4-300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202" srcset="/images/sites/2/2013/03/fea4_zoom4-300x202.jpg 300w, /images/sites/2/2013/03/fea4_zoom4.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/images/2013/03/fea4_zoom4.jpg)

A USB Sound Card, better audio quality than internal sound card of computer (24-bit/96kHz) with a handy volume control on top. Since it connects to computer via a USB cable I can have it on my desk so connecting headphone or microphone to it is much easier too. It allow you to connect your speaker, microphone, aux and headphone all in same time.

## Philips SHE9800 Noise Isolating Earphones

[<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-132" alt="9379-she9800img1[4]" src="/images/2013/03/9379-she9800img14-300x271.jpg" width="300" height="271" srcset="/images/sites/2/2013/03/9379-she9800img14-300x271.jpg 300w, /images/sites/2/2013/03/9379-she9800img14.jpg 442w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/images/2013/03/9379-she9800img14.jpg) [<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-131" alt="9379-boxcase[22]" src="/images/2013/03/9379-boxcase22-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" srcset="/images/sites/2/2013/03/9379-boxcase22-300x190.jpg 300w, /images/sites/2/2013/03/9379-boxcase22.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](/images/2013/03/9379-boxcase22.jpg)

I cannot say if this is best or worst earphone I ever had, this earphone deliver a unique sound quality, not deepest bass nor highest high sounds, expect a sharp and high quality sound from this earphone, I would enjoy a bit more bass but when I hear full range and sharp audio quality of that, it satisfy me.  
This earphone comes with a carry bag that is very useful. It works very well with both my USB Sound Card and my MP3-Player.

Cheers!
