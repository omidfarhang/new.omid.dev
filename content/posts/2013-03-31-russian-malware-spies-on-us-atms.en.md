SecurityWeek <a href="http://www.securityweek.com/exclusive-new-malware-targeting-pos-systems-atms-hits-major-us-banks" target="_blank">reports</a> the author of Dump Memory Grabber has put a video online to teach other hackers how it works. The Windows program written in C++ reads the target system's memory using an external tool called mmon.exe.

Dump Memory Grabber uses FTP to pass card and account numbers, user names, and card expiry dates on to a control server that is most likely run by Russian attackers. Group-IB says that several hundred POS terminals and ATMs in the US have been infected with the program.

Hints in the video lead to a Russian hacker who goes by “Wagner Richard” online and also offers denial-of-service attacks on a number of forums. According to the web site <a href="http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/13213/cyber-crime/exclusive-details-on-investigation-of-group-ib-on-new-age-of-pos-malware.html" target="_blank">Security Affairs</a>, Wagner Richard is a member of a seven-person cybercriminal group.

The [Group-IB](http://www.group-ib.com/) researchers believe that most of the POS terminals and ATMs were infected on site with help from insiders. Only a few of the systems – ones running Windows XP or Windows Embedded – were compromised from a distance. In some cases, the attackers made use of security vulnerabilities in the banks' networks.

Just a few days ago, McAfee reported on a similar trojan, <a href="http://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/vskimmer-botnet-targets-credit-card-payment-terminals" target="_blank">called VSkimmer</a>, that is being sold on cracking forums. The developer of VSkimmer has already announced a successor to their creation that can apparently read chips on cards.

In Germany, for example, the Central Credit Committee <a href="http://www.die-deutsche-kreditwirtschaft.de/uploads/media/DK_Approval_Scheme_V_1_6_120725.pdf" target="_blank">does not allow</a> any POS terminals or ATMs that use Windows. With a middleman or <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Hamburg-police-warns-of-manipulated-card-payment-terminals-1772621.html" target="_blank">manipulated terminals</a>, however, it certainly <a href="http://www.h-online.com/news/item/German-EC-cards-PINs-can-be-stolen-at-card-terminals-1641413.html" target="_blank">wouldn't be impossible</a> to get access to card data and even PINs there, either.
