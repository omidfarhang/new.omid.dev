[![windows update[3]](/images/2013/04/windows-update3.jpg)](/images/2013/04/windows-update3.jpg)Microsoft is making another attempt to close the privilege elevation hole in the NTFS filesystem's kernel driver for Windows 7 and Server 2008, including R2. The new patch, [2840149](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2840149), supersedes security update 2823324, which Microsoft released on its [April Patch Tuesday](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Springtime-for-patches-Microsoft-9-Adobe-3-1838189.html "Springtime for patches: Microsoft 9 - Adobe 3 – 10 April 2013, 09:16").

However, shortly after releasing it, the software giant had to [recall](http://www.h-online.com/news/item/Microsoft-pulls-security-update-for-Windows-and-Windows-Server-1840815.html "Microsoft pulls security update for Windows and Windows Server – 12 April 2013, 10:52") the first update because it caused problems with various third-party programs; it crippled computers and triggered error messages. Kaspersky's anti-virus programs also started acting up once the update was installed, erroneously assuming that they no longer had a valid licence and discontinuing operation. When re-releasing the update, Microsoft didn't clarify whether this was the reason for the system malfunctioning.

The new patch is already being deployed via Windows Update. Microsoft is [offering a bootable recovery disk](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2839011) as an ISO image to customers whose computers have failed to boot since the first patch was installed.
