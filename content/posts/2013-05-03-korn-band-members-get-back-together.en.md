Head, Munky, JD, Fieldy, and Ray are not only together again on-stage for shows beginning May 15, but Korn is also in the studio recording a new album!

“We knew we would have a blast playing together, ‘cause we love each other so much… everything just started pouring out, now I can’t wait until our fans hear this stuff!!” Brian “Head” Welch tells Rolling Stone.
