We have been waiting for it, Tarja will be releasing a new album August 2013, the new album is called “Colours In The Dark”, She explain the album title:

> As the title already clearly points out, you can expect a dark album, but filled with colours.

Current song listing is:

* Never Enough
* Into The Sun
* Medusa
* Lucid Dreamer
* Neverlight
* Until Silence
* Deliverance

Later she says:

> And for the third time the album title comes from a line of one of the songs.

It's “Until Silence” and here is part of the lyrics:

>I saw our memories die\
>thought our dreams had lost their meaning\
>but dreams still in my heart\
>are painting colours in the dark
