We have been waiting for it, Tarja will be releasing a new album August 2013, the new album is called &#8220;Colours In The Dark&#8221;, She explain the album title:

> As the title already clearly points out, you can expect a dark album, but filled with colours.

Current song listing is:

  * Never Enough
  * Into The Sun
  * Medusa
  * Lucid Dreamer
  * Neverlight
  * Until Silence
  * Deliverance

Later she says:

> And for the third time the album title comes from a line of one of the songs.

It's “Until Silence” and here is part of the lyrics:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>I saw our memories die</em><br /> <em>thought our dreams had lost their meaning</em><br /> <em>but dreams still in my heart</em><br /> <em>are painting colours in the dark</em>
</p>
