[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6618" alt="Symantec_120" src="/images/2013/05/Symantec_120.png" width="120" height="120" />](/images/2013/05/Symantec_120.png)Symantec has stopped selling the security-related products in its <a href="http://www.pctools.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">PC Tools portfolio</a>, according to an <a href="http://www.pctools.com/norton-offer/pctEOL/" target="_blank" rel="external">announcement</a> on the company's web site. Customers using the affected programs – Spyware Doctor, Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus, and Internet Security – can continue to use them until their subscription runs out.

Symantec <a href="http://www.pctools.com/kb/article/why-is-symantec-retiring-the-pc-tools-security-portfolio-567.html" target="_blank" rel="external">says</a> that the decision is related to consolidating its product range in order to offer customers fewer but higher quality products. To that end, the company suggests that customers looking to replace the discontinued products consider Norton Internet Security.

Symantec acquired PC Tools in 2008. One of the company's most popular security programs was ThreatFire, a virus scanner that detected malicious programs based on their behaviour; over the last few years, however, it has only been only available as part of PC Tools Internet Security.
