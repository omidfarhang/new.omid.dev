DMC And Wayne Static of Static-X Join Forces To Shoot Video For New Track &#8220;Noise Revolution&#8221;

DMC of the legendary RUN-DMC and Wayne Static will be shooting a video for a new track entitled &#8220;Noise Revolution&#8221; in the coming weeks. DMC, one of the pioneers of Hip Hop music is also credited as being the first to blend rock with rap most notably with a RUN-DMC rendition of &#8220;Walk This Way&#8221; by Aerosmith which also featured vocals by Steven Tyler. Once again DMC looks to break new ground by synthesizing the industrial sound of Wayne Static's undeniable vocal approach with his trail blazing rap style. The video will be directed by Matt Zane (Wayne Static, Zakk Wylde, Orgy, Society 1, Annihilated)

&#8220;The Noise Revolution song and video is a powerful statement that shows that our art and creativity is the most important representation of the people. Working with Wayne Static and Matt Zane to knock down walls and bring people together with a positive message is inspiring and empowering!&#8221; said DMC

Wayne Static is no stranger to combining different styles and is known for the creation of &#8220;Evil Disco&#8221; and when the chance to work with one of the all time great Hip Hop artists presented itself there was absolutely no hesitation.

&#8220;The opportunity to work with a legend like DMC was a great honor and an experience like no other. We performed onstage together in Austin a while back and I hope we have more opportunities to perform together again.&#8221; said Wayne

Wayne also went on to explain how he has always been in favor of combining different genres of music.

&#8220;I have always believed combining different genres of music is a great way to create exciting new sounds. In fact I've based most of my career on combining unexpected styles in innovative ways. This collaboration with DMC is a prime example of how we can break through traditional expectations of Metal and Rap to create a bad ass new sound, and that is really the theme of the song for me as well. This song is a &#8220;Noise Revolution!&#8221;

Matt Zane was even in awe to be presented with opportunity to direct the video.

&#8220;I was all about The Doors, Van Halen, King Diamond and RUN-DMC when I was growing up. When DMC flew out to Los Angeles to meet I couldn't believe I was sitting across the table from him discussing concepts for something I was going to direct. I was trying to keep it together but really my mind was going crazy. I didn't want to let on that I was such a huge fan and had all the records. &#8221; said Zane

Stay tuned to see the &#8220;Noise Revolution&#8221; in late June.
