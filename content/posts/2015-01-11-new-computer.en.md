Happy New Computer (To me!)

Finally it was time to get a new computer as the old one was not working any longer for my needs and about a month ago passed away with a broken Graphic Card.

After saving a few $$$ and considering my budget I got a good balance of power-computer and price.

Here is configuration of my new computer _(Click on images to see full size)_:

**Motherboard: ASUS Z97-K**

&nbsp;

This motherboard offer a very good performance and support high speed RAM and also support Intel Extreme CPU series. It has on-board graphic card with HDMI, DVI and VGA output which is useless for me since I got a good graphic card too. It has several SATA 6G, 4 USB3 and Turbo LAN ports. also using the front-panel ports you get more USB and Audio ports.

**Graphic Card: ASUS R7 250X**

2GB GDDR5 rocking with AMD ATI R7 250x series processor, supporting crossfire. dual fan cooling system keeps it cool without any noise.

**RAM: G.SKILL 4GB (x2)**

I did not need much space as I use several external hard disk to save my files. a SSD hard will be added soon as they had not any available on the day I went to store.

**Power: EVGA SuperNOVA NEX 750 Gold**

A very heavy and stable power supply to feed all those devices, Powerful and elegant with nice set of cables.
