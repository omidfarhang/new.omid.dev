Starting today, January 10th, Windows 7 Enterprise and Professional operating systems will no longer receive security updates. Thus, computers that still run these OS will no longer be protected against critical vulnerabilities.

Apart from the operating system itself, browsers (both Edge and third-party browsers), as well as services from other non-Microsoft vendors, such as NVIDIA, have confirmed that they have also stopped offering new security patches in Windows 7.

### Actions to be taken

You should upgrade your Microsoft Windows to newer versions, if your hardware does not support Windows 11, you may upgrade to Windows 10 or maybe consider switching to another Operation System like Linux.
