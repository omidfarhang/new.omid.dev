**Tiësto** (IPA: /tiɛsto/; born **Tijs Verwest** (IPA: /tɛɪs vɛɹʋɛst/) on January 17, 1969 in Breda, North Brabant, Netherlands) is one of the world's most famous trance DJs and producers in the electronic dance music scene. Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as **DJ Tiësto**. On his latest productions, however, he has dropped the “DJ” label and he is now known simply as “Tiësto”, an alias which is an Italian twist on his childhood nickname.

His accomplishments include being voted “World’s No.1 DJ ” 3 consecutive times by DJ Magazine from 2002 through 2004, the first DJ to play live on stage in front of a public audience at an Olympic Games at the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Athens, and a nomination for a Grammy Award in 2008, for his album _Elements of Life_.

Tiësto's motto is: “_I feel the energy from the crowd and I try to give it back, to create a unity._”

#### History

##### Early years (1985–2000)

Tijs Verwest had an interest for music since the age of twelve. When he was twenty he decided to dedicate more time to it and began DJing professionally at school parties and then moved on to become a resident DJ between 1985 and 1994 at several clubs in the Netherlands after his manager and friend Wilfred encouraged him. During these years, he produced hardcore/gabber tracks under aliases such as Da Joker and DJ Limited. However, it was at _The Spock_, a small club in Breda, where he was able to fine-tune his own style by playing in a separate room from 10 pm until 4 am on weekends. In the beginning of his carrier as DJ he mostly played new beat and acid house, and many Madonna songs because her music shows that she likes to dance. Before the release of her album there where already dancemixes like Vogue which was one of the songs of Spock. He was discovered by the GM of Rotterdam-based _Basic Beat Recordings_, Tiësto released his first of five mix CDs as a part of the label's Forbidden Paradise series.

In the mid-1990s, he started to produce trance, which led to his breakthough in 1995 when he started building mixed compilations, something nobody else did at that time. Tiësto describes his Magik (series) as part of his breakthrough, but since the labels only want their own songs in the deejay mixes, in 1997 he and Arny Bink co-founded Black Hole Recordings to support his work releasing a series of singles under various aliases. Black Hole Recordings and its sub-label Magik Muzik continue to sign Tiësto's vision of trance – producing musicians and DJs such as Cor Fijneman, Ton TB, and Mark Norman and also Joe Cheang. During this period, DJ Tiësto had been releasing the Magik series, which has had seven installments starting in 1997 and ending in 2001, after this Tiësto began releasing the In Search of Sunrise series, that is a compilation of Tiësto's mixes with tracks from other DJ's. In 1999, Tiësto joined forces with fellow Dutch deejay Ferry Corsten to create the trance based duo of Gouryella. To highlight the importance in the expansion of the trance environment at the time, there were 20 different CD releases of the 4 Gouryella tracks from 9 different labels. Since November 1999 he monthly performed as a resident in Gatecrasher at Leeds, one of the most popular clubs of England.  In 1999 he also played in a 12-hour set, being his longest lasting concert in Amsterdam.

##### Rise to fame (2000–2004)

[![dj+tiesto+club+life](/images/2008/05/dj+tiesto+club+life-300x300.jpg)](/images/2008/05/dj+tiesto+club+life.jpg)Late in 2000, Tiësto decided to concentrate on his personal work and left Corsten by himself to write and produce Gouryella's next single with John Ewbank, the record company was demanding more tracks and neither Tiësto or Ferry could work together at the time. Tiësto introduced Armin van Buuren, Johan Gielen and Ferry Corsten to the mainstream with his first compilations and the _In Trance We Trust (series)_. Summerbreeze became Tiësto's debute dj mix album in the United States with the help of a contract signed to Nettwerk. Summerbreeze featured his remix of Delerium's Silence, it spent four weeks in the United Kingdom's Top Ten chart, it reached number three in the Billboard dance chart and is still an epic track. In early 2001, Tiësto broke a world record by drinking “31 cans of Red Bull in 24 hours”, he admitted he would never try and break it again.

Tiësto's fame started to rise in the early 2000s after his set at the first ID&T Innercity party (Live at Innercity: Amsterdam RAI), and the release of In My Memory, his first solo album released in 2001 which contained 10 singles. On February 2, 2002, Tiësto played nine consecutive hours during the second edition of the Dutch Dimension festival. On February 27 he was awarded a Zilveren (‘Silver') Harp music award. The same year he also received a Lucky Strike Dance Award in the category Best DJ Trance/Progressive. In August he became part of Moby's Area2 Tour. For eighteen days he traveled through the United States with artists such as Moby himself, but also David Bowie and Busta Rhymes.  After Junkie XL's chart topping success with the Elvis Presley remix A Little Less Conversation, Tiësto releases a remix of the Elvis track Burning Love, he is then nominated for a Dance Award by the UK's Muzik Magazine in the category Best Radio 1 Essential Mix. In January 2003 Tiësto received the annual Dutch Popprijs (‘Pop Award') during the Noorderslag festival. After touring with Moby, Tiësto remixed two songs from him, We Are All Made of Stars and Extreme Ways in the same year, having “We Are All Made of Stars” reach #13 in the Hot Dance Club Play.

His fame continued to skyrocket in the early 2000s following his six-hour “Tiësto Solo” sets which he performed without other DJs or opening acts. This idea, of one DJ playing alone to a large crowd, was brought to its pinnacle when Tiësto was the first DJ to hold a solo concert in a stadium; on May 10, 2003, he performed for over 25,000 people in Arnhem's Gelredome. This concert was later called “Tiësto in Concert”, the event was an enormous success. He repeated the same type of concert the following year during two consecutive nights in late October. In addition to holding these two concerts for 35,000 of his fans, he held another concert for a crowd of 20,000 in Hasselt, Belgium the following week. DVDs of both his May 10, 2003 and October 30, 2004 concerts have been released, having the other DVD titled “Tiësto In Concert 2”. The DVD's show the journey from the first idea to the main event, it features live performances by Andain, Dinand Woesthoff, and Jan Johnston. The event includes live music and dancers performing at different times throughout the set. The theme of the event is a mystical, musical journey around the world based on the theme of _Magik_.  It consists of 200+ minutes of performances with a second disc with special features, It includes a behind-the-scenes looking at _The Making Of the event_, the music video for his song “Traffic” and TV Commercials for the event. The second DVD has performance from Matt Hales from Aqualung and violin player DJ Mason, Micha Klein and the Bulgarian Children of Orpheus choir. During this period he was crowned as “No. 1. DJ in the World” by DJ Magazine (UK) in 2002, 2003, and 2004. In 2004 he released his second artist album Just Be, which featured his first single _Traffic_ which is the first non-vocal track to reach number one spot in the Dutch national charts for 23 years. Tiësto and Kirsty Hawkshaw's production and single _“Just Be”_ appeared in the Nip / Tuck: Original TV Soundtrack, and _“Love Comes Again”_ was used in a Coca-Cola commercial in Holland. Tiësto's remix of the Kane song “Rain Down on Me” is featured in the game FIFA Football 2004. In support to his Just Be album, he played at Breda, Eindhoven, Utrecht, and Amsterdam, this stops were later named Tiësto – Just Be: Train Tour, this tour was not planned for people to know about it. On May 20, Ascension Day, when he got on the train in his hometown of The Hague to go to Breda, he was honored by the mayor and the citizens, he was then named an officer in the name of the royal family Oranje-Nassau.

###### Olympics Opening Ceremony

[![Olympic_flame_at_opening_ceremony](/images/2008/05/Olympic_flame_at_opening_ceremony-300x214.jpg)](/images/2008/05/Olympic_flame_at_opening_ceremony.jpg)The Athens Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (ATHOC) asked Tiësto to perform at the Olympic Games, making him the first DJ to play live on stage at an Olympic Games at the 2004 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony in Athens for 90 minutes.

Tiësto flew to Athens in January 2004 to have a meeting with the ATHOC. The reason why they asked him to perform was because of his Tiësto in Concert DVD which caught their attention, he was asked to write more tracks based on his opening tune Adagio for Strings which could fit in with the Olympic spirit and combine the classical with the modern age; They also request him to play his own produced music. The first rehearsal was on Saturday 7, August for an empty stadium, the second rehearsal was on Sunday 8 with 35,000 volunteers, alot of the people recognized some tracks like Traffic and Adagio for Strings. The last rehearsal included almost 60,000 people in the stadium which was on Tuesday 10, there were some technical problems, the mixer broke down, the monitors dropped out a couple of times and the music in the stadium was not continuously on the right volume.

> “The opportunity to perform my music for billions of people around the globe will be the greatest highlight of my life, I am honoured to be part of the biggest sports event in the world.”
> – said Tiësto about the ATHOC.

During the parade on Friday 13, all participating nations introduced their athletes which were over 10,500 in total and 80,000 in the public, only 75,000 knew about dance music. During the course of his performance the Dutch athletes started dancing in front of the DJ booth and had to be moved on by officials. The performance included new tracks produced especially for the Opening Ceremony and songs that were created to compliment the spirit and theme of the Ceremony. A condensed studio-recorded album of the songs played on the Olympic set was later released, including new songs especially composed for the occasion, entitled _Parade of the Athletes_ in October 2004. In the liner notes, he noted the IOC requested to him that the music not contain any lyrics as they could be inadvertently misinterpreted.

##### Concerts and side work (2005-2006)

[![tiesto](/images/2008/05/tiesto-300x198.jpg)](/images/2008/05/tiesto.jpg)In January 6 Tiësto performed in an outdoor fundraiser in De Dam, Amsterdam, the event was free and many famous Dutch artists like Dinand Woesthoff, Bløf, Acda & De Munnik, Di-rect, Berget Lewis, Xander de Buisonjé and Trijntje Oosterhuiswere involved in it to provide financial aid to the people who suffered from the tsunami in Asia. All profits made of all TV commercials and live broadcast were given to the organisations collecting the relief funds. On April 16, 2005, Disneyland Resort Paris who had recently ignaurated the Space Mountain: Mission 2, had invited Tiësto to celebrate the launch of the ride by offering a live concert in Disneyland Park. Tiësto performed a special remix of the Space Mountain: Mission 2 soundtrack, as well as many of his own tracks. _Tiësto's Space Mountain: Mission 2 Concert_ also featured French deejay Bob Sinclar, the park would re-open for Tiësto's fans so they could stay for the 3 hour concert. A sculpture of Tiësto was placed behind a turntable where Madame Tussauds visitors can mix Tiësto's music together with the man himself and he also won and Edison music award in the category Best Dance. The Dutch national soccer competition is the most viewed program on Dutch television, Tiësto is the first potential artist to become an inspiration to the programs directors which created a tune based on his performance in the Olympic Games. The tune “Match of the day” was played in all soccer stadiums before each match when the teams entered the field.

On August 20, 2005 Verwest took “Tiësto in Concert” to the United States when he played to thousands of fans in Los Angeles, California in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. For the second year in a row he performed live at a New Year's Eve/New Year's concert in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Orleans Arena to a sell-out crowd. Despite his four-city American tour being postponed due to the hurricane damage in New Orleans and Miami, playing such cities in the United States further expanded and cemented his popularity among more mainstream audiences. In the fall of 2005 he went on a very successful tour across Central and Eastern Europe where he played once in each country to crowds of 10,000 to 15,000 fans. Stops were made in Ukraine, Slovakia, Serbia, Macedonia, Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Croatia, and Poland. Tiësto also performed at the UNITY festival in South Africa where he played a show at the Gallagher Estate Arena in Midrand, a suburb of Johannesburg, to over 18,000 fans. However, the United States tour that was part of “Tiësto in Concert” was dwarfed by his appearance at Sensation White in 2006 where he performed to over 45,000 people in the world's biggest dance event in Amsterdam, Holland. Even this was surpassed later in the same summer where some 250,000 people danced on Ipanema Beach, Brazil, the second largest concert in the history of mankind.
