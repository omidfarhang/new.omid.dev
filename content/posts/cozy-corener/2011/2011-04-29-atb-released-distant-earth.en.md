**“Distant Earth”** is ATB's 9th studio album, which was released on the 29th of April 2011, by Kontor Records. It features 2 CDs in the standard edition, 3 CDs in the limited edition, and 3 CDs + 5 ATB signed postcards + ATB bracelet in the FanBox Limited Edition (which can be ordered on Amazon and it is limited to 2000 copies). Also, there is another 2 CD digipack version that comes with an ATB sticker and it's available only in Germany.

The first CD is an ATB-standard tracks CD, which contains tracks featuring artists like Josh Gallahan, Amurai, Dash Berlin, Sean Ryan, Rea Garvey, Melissa Loretta or JanSoon. The second CD is an ambient / lounge CD which brings us a surprising collaboration with Armin van Buuren for the track called “Vice Versa”, and, finally, the third CD contains the club versions of the tracks found on the first CD.
