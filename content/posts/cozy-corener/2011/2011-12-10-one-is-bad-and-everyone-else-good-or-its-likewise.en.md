There are so many groups of people in world, we all know that, So many different group and kind of people, we can group them with different factors, with their born location, with their skin color, with their hair color, with eyes color, being left hand or right hand, with their political view, with their religious view and believes, with their education levels, with their languages, with their music tastes and…

Here I’m not going talk about society or similar stuff; I want to talk about how good, wise and expert people fail or lose against bad, dumb and ignorance people, why? Because this second group is the majority, does it make sense?

These are some example:

* You become fan of a good musician: Both you and music experts agree that this musician is doing really a great job and making best music on the world, but his music don’t get any luck in the market because his music is not some silly sounds that ‘majority’ like, so to be able survive that musician turn into silly sounds majority wants. 
* You find an ideal software company which their products is best for you, and their products really works for you and every IT expert gives a thumb up to that and say that this is useful for everyone, but that company fail in gaining market because majority don’t like it and prefer another fancy software, so your favorite software become alike that fancy program to keep its market.
* You start using an online service which is very useful for your life, not only your life but everyone else life too, but majority don’t come use that so the developer of that service find that they are wasting their resource and discontinue it.

And millions of other examples which you can imagine, so what you say? Now you must understand me better, do you think there are solution for that? what should we do when we get into such situation? share your opinion  in the comments.
