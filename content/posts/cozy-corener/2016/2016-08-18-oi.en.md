Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Everywhere I go all the ladies wanna touch me  
And when I'm on the road, I'm always spot by paparazzi  
Did it for the fame but always did it for the joy  
&#8216;Cause everywhere I go they scream &#8216;oi, fucking oi'  
All around the world you see my face on TV  
And all around the world they want to be like H.P.  
I never played the game, always been the bad boy  
And everywhere I go they scream &#8216;oi, fucking oi'  
Yeah

Don't take life too seriously  
Nobody gets out alive anyway

Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Scream!  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Louder!  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Yeah!

Everywhere I went, yeah, I brought the bass  
Been spitting super-tight bars right into your face  
Raise your hands, lean back and enjoy  
And watch the crowd go &#8216;oi, fucking oi', yeah

Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Come on, right?  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Yes!  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi  
Oi, oi, oi, fucking oi
