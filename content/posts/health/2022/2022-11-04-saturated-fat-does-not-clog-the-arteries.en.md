I've been reading an [article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326269#dairy-saturated-fat-and-heart-health) from medicalnewstoday.com and I found this part interesting:

> A team of cardiologists [wrote an article](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/51/15/1111) stating that eating foods with saturated fat does not clog the arteries, as people once believed. They contend that the “fat free” movement caused higher intakes of carbohydrate foods, including sugars. This might explain why rates of heart disease have increased.

Here is the link to the article mentioned above from BMJ Journal: [Saturated fat does not clog the arteries: coronary heart disease is a chronic inflammatory condition, the risk of which can be effectively reduced from healthy lifestyle interventions](https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/51/15/1111)
