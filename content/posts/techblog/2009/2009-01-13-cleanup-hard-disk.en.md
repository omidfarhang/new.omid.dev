The Disk Cleanup tool helps you free up space on your hard disk to improve the performance of your computer. The tool identifies files that you can safely delete, and then enables you to choose whether you want to delete some or all of the identified files.  

Why Cleanup
-----------

* Remove temporary Internet files.
* Remove downloaded program files (such as Microsoft ActiveX controls and Java applets).
* Empty the Recycle Bin.
* Remove Windows temporary files such as error reports.
* Remove optional Windows components that you don't use.
* Remove installed programs that you no longer use.
* Remove unused restore points and shadow copies from System Restore.

**Tip**: Typically, temporary Internet files take the most amount of space because the browser caches each page you visit for faster access later.

How to Cleanup
--------------

There are many ways to cleanup disk space, here I will list my preferred:

* Use [Auslogics BoostSpeed](/knowledge-base/programs/boostspeed) **\[Recommended\]**
* Use [CCleander](/knowledge-base/programs/ccleaner)
* Use Windows Disc Cleanup

### To use Auslogica BoostSpeed \[Recommended\]

1. Open BoostSpeed from System Tray or Shortcut on Desktop or Start menu
2. In the system scan tab you click click on Once Click Scan which will scan your system for Disc Cleaup, defragment, registry error and hard disc problem  
    Or  
    Go to Advanced Tools, Under Disk Maintenance click on 'Cleanup'
3. In the Opened window choose which area you want to it cleanup and Click Scan Now and finally after scan check files for what you want to keep or remove.
