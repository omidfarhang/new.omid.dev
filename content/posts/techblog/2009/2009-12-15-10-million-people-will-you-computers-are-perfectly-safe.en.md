**New rogue borrows massively from AV company sites**

Our friend M.N. Bharath drew our attention to this web site associated with the new System Adware Scanner 2010 rogue security product. Although the group claims 10 million users world-wide, oddly enough their site was only registered Nov. 25.

It seems they also have recruited the entire management team from AVG anti-virus company as well. Right!

Compare the names on the Smart Systems Technologies rogue page.
