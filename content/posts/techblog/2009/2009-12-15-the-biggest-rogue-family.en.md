**The third generation of WiniGuard gets a new clone every 48 hours**

A new rogue security product called [IGuardPC](http://sites.google.com/site/boelectronic/computer/malware/list-of-common-malwares/iguardpc), is the 50th clone of the WiniGuard family of rogue security products. That makes WiniGuard the largest rogue family ever.

The WiniGuard family began in September of 2008. Operators behind it have added variants that has sorted into three generations. The latest generation gets a new clone about every 48 hours to stay ahead of public awareness and anti-malware detections.

**First Generation**

The first generation of WiniGuard used the site winiguard.com. It was created Sept. 17, 2008, by the same group who probably began circulating rogues using macguard.net, which has the same IP address. WiniGuard installed five files.

**Second Generation**

SaveKeep, first found August 17, marked the beginning of the second generation. This was distinguished by the use of two files instead of five.

Today’s IGuardPC makes a total of 50 clones — the largest family we’ve ever found:
