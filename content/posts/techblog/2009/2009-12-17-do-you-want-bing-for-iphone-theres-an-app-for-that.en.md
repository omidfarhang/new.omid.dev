Earlier this evening, Microsoft formally announced a new search app for iPhone on the [Bing Community blog](http://www.bing.com/community/blogs/search/archive/2009/12/15/bing-for-mobile-comes-to-the-iphone.aspx). The Bing app is available now from the App Store, complete with voice search. I emphasize the now because the app has a December 16 release date on the 15th.

Based on a very quick, cursory look, Bing is a competent iPhone app, tapping into the kind of capabilities expected from the platform. Bing fits nicely into the App Store repertoire. I wouldn't call the features revolutionary — Apple and Google are there already with advanced mapping and GPS — but the packaging appeals, and Microsoft manages to offer a user experience that is fairly consistent with Bing Web search.

“Our investments in voice search (you may have played with them on Windows phones or BlackBerry already) continues in our iPhone App and works great for map locations as well as old fashioned web search,” according to the Microsoft blog post announcing Bing for iPhone.” Just say &#8216;San Francisco weather,' for a quick result, or even say a full address for a map or directions. Try something complex, like &#8216;1 Microsoft Way, Redmond 98052.' (Yes, I know how to get to work.) Hold the phone to your ear and speak, or press the mic button — simple.”

Google's iPhone search app also supports voice search, which is prominently available on Android phones. Voice search is a great utility and demonstrates how natural user interfaces can greatly improve the smartphone data experience compared to PCs. I would — again, from a quick look — pick Bing voice search over Google on iPhone, but find Google's voice search in Android to be more appealing.

Microsoft also touts location search tied to mapping and GPS: “Speaking of directions (ha), looking for a coffee shop nearby? Bing automatically finds your location. It's also easy to discover a new spot by category such as restaurants, banks, theaters and choose whether you want walking or driving directions.”

Location-awareness isn't exactly new to iPhone, but at least Microsoft offers an alternative to the Google Maps functionality built into the device. The mapping feature looks promising, but will require more testing for proper evaluation. The visuals impress, at least. Still, regardless of merits, Bing mapping features are Google catchups.

The Bing home screen is nicely laid out, and it comes with the expected background image typically found on the Website search page. Categories like businesses, directions, movies or maps help simplify search. Clearly there is emphasis on local search, which absolutely is the right priority. I love the photo search, by the way. Presentation is simply awesome.

Many pundits will quip about how Microsoft is conceding something by releasing an iPhone app and not keeping Bing solely for Windows Mobile. Microsoft already offers a Bing search app for other mobile platforms, and even more supported platforms is the right strategy. Search is the future of mobile phones — and any advertising packaged along with it. Microsoft had better be there or be square. Bing search should be available for all mobile platforms. Bing for iPhone is smart business. The concession would be keeping Bing only for Windows Mobile.

Early end user App Store reviews are positive (I won't guess how many are Microsoft employees). Commenter Xuedonghuang writes: “It's a great Christmas gift from Microsoft.”
