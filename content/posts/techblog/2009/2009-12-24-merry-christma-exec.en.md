Once again, we'd like to wish our readers Merry Christmas with a reference to the 1986 CHRISTMA EXEC worm

[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/SzPYmT4CftI/AAAAAAAAAgA/Ds2ClemcCfY/s640/CHRISTMA+EXEC.gif)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/SzPYmT4CftI/AAAAAAAAAgA/Ds2ClemcCfY/s1600-h/CHRISTMA+EXEC.gif)

Here's a link to [January 1987 Risks Digest](http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/6.01.html), discussing the worm.

And here's a link to [the original source code](http://pastebin.com/m289959a6) for this worm. Normally we wouldn't link to malware code, but hey, **it's 23 years old**.
