Desktop Security 2010 is a rogue antispyware program, designed to trick people into thinking it is a legitimate program. Desktop Security 2010 uses fake security warnings and system scans to frighten people into buying the software. If Desktop Security 2010 is installed on your PC, you should remove it immediately as it is a potentially dangerous computer infection.

Computers that have been infected with Desktop Security 2010 may show the following symptoms:

  * System scans that report numerous infections, yet requires purchase of System Defender before it will remove the infections (These are fictitious scan results)
  * Alerts and Pop-Up system warnings stating the PC is infected and recommend purchase of System Defender (These warnings are fake)
  * Web browser redirecting to random websites (these websites are owned by cyber thieves and will further infect your PC)
  * System Defender will prevent other programs from opening, stating they are infected (The programs are not infected)

If Desktop Security 2010 has infected your computer, you must remove it soon.
