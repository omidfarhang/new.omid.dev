Facebook started [rolling out a new home page and navigation menus](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=287459122130) earlier today.

And whenever Facebook adds new features, in this case the **Applications and Games dashboards**, there's usually a new privacy setting as well.

This is what part of the new Applications dashboard looks like.

All Facebook has raised some privacy concerns regarding the dashboard's output.

Do you really want all of your “friends” to know what applications you've been running?

You don't?

Then you'll want to take a look at the new control provided by Facebook.

Here's the old Applications and Websites settings page.

Here are the new settings.

The new privacy option allows you to “Control who can see your activity in the Friends' Recent Activity, Friends' Applications and Friends' Games sections of these pages.”

The control options should be familiar enough at this point. Sharing can be set to Only Friends, Friends of Friends and Everyone. Of course, utilizing Friends Lists can limit access in a more refined manner.
