If your PC is infected with SecurePcAv you will most likely experience the following:

  * Fake system scans that report numerous infections and refuses to remove the supposed infections until you buy the phony software.
  * Alerts and warnings stating the PC is under attack or unprotected and recommends you buy the phony software.
  * Other software will not work, when attempting to open programs a warning stating the program is infected appears and the software is closed.
  * Web browser hijacking, redirecting the user to malicious websites or showing false security warnings on sites like Google.com.
