Since January we publish monthly reports about the categories of the spam messages which got sent around the last month. These categories are detected by Avira’s AntiSpam engine.

Between January and February 2010 there didn’t change much in the spam landscape. The top 3 is still occupied by Pharmacy, Other (spams which don’t fit any category) and watches. However, this month the Malware category made its way on the 4th with 4.9% after it was only 0.5% in January.

People should really stop buying meds from online pharmacies which get advertised in spam messages. If the business model is no longer existing, they will stop spamming.
