Do you want to avoid unwanted **telemarketing** calls and SMS, arriving on your Mobile or Landline phones from Telecom companies which aim to provide additional services, promotions, offers, plans, tariffs, etc?  
National Do Not Call Registry ([NDNC Registry](http://ndncregistry.gov.in/ndncregistry/index.jsp)) is a measure from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, whose main objective is to control Unsolicited Commercial Communication (**UCC**) and let you get rid of it.

**To Register in NDNC Registry** – Call 1909 (toll free) or SMS **START DND** to **1909** (toll free). In case you want to de-register yourself from the NDNC registry SMS **STOP DND** to **1909** (toll free).  
Alternatively, users can visit the **‘Do not Call/Disturb’** registration webpage of their desired telecom subscribers to apply for same.
