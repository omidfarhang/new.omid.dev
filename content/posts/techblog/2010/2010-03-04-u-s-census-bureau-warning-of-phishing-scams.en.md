The U.S. Census Bureau is warning of phishing and other scams that are using the 2010 Census as bait. Here is the warning from the bureau’s web site:

> If you are contacted for any of the following reasons — Do Not Participate. It is NOT the U.S. Census Bureau.

**Phishing:**

&#8216;Phishing' is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, social security numbers, bank account or credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Phishing is typically carried out by email and it often directs users to enter sensitive information at a fake web site whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.

**Other Scams:**

- The Census Bureau does NOT conduct the 2010 Census via the Internet
- The Census Bureau does not send emails about participating in the 2010 Census

**The Census Bureau never:**

- Asks for your full social security number
- Asks for money or a donation
- Sends requests on behalf of a political party
- Requests PIN codes, passwords or similar access information for credit cards, banks or other financial accounts.
