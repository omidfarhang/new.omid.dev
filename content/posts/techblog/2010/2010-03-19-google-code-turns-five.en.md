At age five most kids can hop, skip and tie their shoes without help. [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) turns five this week, and while they’re still working on the shoelaces thing, they’ve grown from a simple site for hosting a couple of APIs into a destination for developers to prototype their ideas in a [Code Playground](http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground/), host all kinds of [open source projects](http://code.google.com/hosting/) and find out about our growing family of [APIs](http://code.google.com/more/) and products like [App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and [Android](http://developer.android.com/index.html).

To learn more about how [code.google.com](http://code.google.com/) has come alive over the past five years, check out our post on the [Google Code Blog](http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2010/03/happy-5th-birthday-google-code.html).
