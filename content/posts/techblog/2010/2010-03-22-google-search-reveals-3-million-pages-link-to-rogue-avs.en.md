Do you know what the latest version of Adobe‚Äôs Flash Player is? If you don‚Äôt, you may very well fall for this:

Flash Player 11?

There are more than 3 million pages linking to this alleged version 11:

Most pages are from unsanitized forums, but there is even a Google Ad for it! Ooooops‚Ä¶.

The screen below depicts the social engineering trick: What appears to be an X-rated video with a Windows Media Player logo (that is odd!).

What intrigued me in that screenshot was that this malicious post was made with a user account that was highly rated:

[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S6eLt-sT_JI/AAAAAAAABWU/ArRhqrLzoCQ/s1600/hero.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/S6eLt-sT_JI/AAAAAAAABWU/ArRhqrLzoCQ/s1600-h/hero.png)

Such posts are automated, so I‚Äôd guess this user got his credentials stolen. Regardless, it adds to the deceptiveness, coming from what looks like an ‚Äòapproved‚Äô forum user.

¬†What happens next is an intermediary URL, freevideos.osa.pl/video.php?, redirects you to fast flux domains updated on a regular basis, all showing the well known ‚ÄúYouTube-like‚Äù screenie:

Clicking on it will download ‚Äòvideo-plugin.45210.exe‚Äô (Virus Total detection [here](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/c3b76274c1162b2c8e10c2aeca63b5d352d99a38a1263f5497c0b137097f16a0-1268690835))

¬†So, what really is the latest Adobe Flash Player? The answer: 10.0.45.2

You can find it here <http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/>

Looks like the bad guys are already one step ahead. By the way, I did a Google search with version 12 and it returned nothing üòâ

In the meantime, there are million of pages out there fooling people and infecting them with a non-existent Flash Player version.
