Have you ever wanted to quickly send a file to a friend who's online? Now you can share pictures, documents and other files directly with your friends while chatting in [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig) and [orkut](http://www.orkut.com/), without having to switch to email to send the file as an attachment. File transfer works directly in the browser so you don't need to install anything. Just start a conversation with a friend and click “Send a file…” in the “Actions” menu. After you select a file, your friend will be asked if they want to accept the transfer. You can learn more on the [Google Talkabout Blog](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2010/03/file-transfer-in-igoogle-and-orkut-chat.html).

You might have noticed that Google recently gave iGoogle and orkut chat a face lift. Several tools now have a new home at the top of the chat window. From the new toolbar, you can click the blue camera [![](http://imgur.com/U8qdE.gif)](http://imgur.com/U8qdE.gif) and phone icons [![](http://imgur.com/BXw76.png)](http://imgur.com/BXw76.png) to start [video and voice chats](http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2009/08/video-chat-from-igoogle.html) with your friends or the group chat icon [![](http://imgur.com/uht93.gif)](http://imgur.com/uht93.gif) to add additional friends to a text chat. If you've never used video or voice chat before, all you need is a webcam and microphone attached to your computer and a small plugin application available for free at [www.google.com/chat/video](http://www.google.com/chat/video).

Google is working to bring file transfer and the new toolbar to [Gmail](http://mail.google.com/) too. In the meantime, you can continue to access voice, video and group chat in Gmail from the “Video and More” menu in a chat window.
