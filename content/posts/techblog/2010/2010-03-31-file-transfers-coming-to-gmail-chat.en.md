Google has revealed that users can now transfer files via chat in iGoogle and Orkut.

This is good news for web users with a preference for software-free chatting, but the better news is that Google promises to bring the same functionality to Gmail, which already supports voice, video and group chat.

The iGoogle and Orkut file transfers will work for photos, documents and presumably small video files. In addition, web users can exchange files with users of Google Talk — the more robust desktop version of Google’s chat client — without any hiccups.

We certainly look forward to the day when file transfers will be supported via chat in Gmail, and we’ll update you when we know more. Until then, let us know what you think about the new iGoogle and Orkut functionality in the comments.
