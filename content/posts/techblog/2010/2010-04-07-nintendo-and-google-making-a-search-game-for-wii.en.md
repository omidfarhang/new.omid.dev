This just in from the “Strange Bedfellows” department: apparently [Nintendo has enlisted the help of Google](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/07/nintendo-teams-with-google-for-glorified-google-fight-gameplay/) to create a Wii game where players compete to guess the most popular search terms.

The game, entitled _Ando Kensaku_, will be out in Japan on April 29 and won’t likely see much of a release elsewhere given its quirkiness. The screenshot above gives you an idea of the cutesy avatar style of the title, featuring 14 mini-games where several players can choose from a multiple choice search term spread.

Who knew SEO could be fodder for a casual Wii game? Anyone else have a hankering for a special Web Nerd U.S. Edition of this thing?
