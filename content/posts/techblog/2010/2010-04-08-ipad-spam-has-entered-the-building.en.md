It was only a matter of time before the merest of “iPad” mentions on sites such as Twitter would result in autospammed messages like this:

You’ll have to fill in a big chunk of personal information and _“receive the incentive gift package by completing two reward offers from each of the Top, Prime and Premium reward offer page options…completion of reward offers most often requires a purchase or filing a credit application and being accepted for a financial product such as a credit card or consumer loan.”_
