Adobe has announced that it will release an updater along with Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9.3.2 and 8.2.2 on patch Tuesday next week.

On the Adobe blog, Steve Gottwals wrote: “…we have been testing a new updater technology with select beta customers since our October 13, 2009 quarterly update. The purpose of the new updater is to keep end-users up-to-date in a much more streamlined and automated way. 

“During our quarterly update on January 12, 2010, and then again for an out-of-cycle update on February 16, 2010, we exercised the new updater with our beta testers. This allowed us to test a variety of network configurations encountered on the Internet in order to ensure a robust update experience. That beta process has been a successful one, and we've incorporated several positive changes to the end-user experience and system operation. Now, we're ready for the next phase of deployment.”

Users can set an “Automatically install updates” control or not, as they wish.

Given the attention that malcode creators have lavished on Adobe products recently, an updater to go along with regular “patch Tuesday” updates will certainly help us all have a good “end-user experience.”
