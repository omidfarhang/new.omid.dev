Yahoo Movies has [posted the newest trailer](http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/sex-and-the-city-2.html?showVideo=1) for the upcoming film, _Sex and the City 2._ The sequel to the 2008 box office hit comes to theaters on May 28, 2010.

While \_Sex and the City 2\_ has the obligatory [Facebook Fan Page](http://www.facebook.com/sexandthecity2), the film’s [website](http://sexandthecitymovie.com/) is still pretty barren — at least for now.

In 2008, HBO and New Line put together a more interactive campaign, including a site that let you [explore Carrie’s MacBook Pro](http://www.tuaw.com/2008/05/20/explore-carrie-bradshaws-macbook-pro/), but we’ll have to wait and see if they do anything like that this time around.

What do you think of the new trailer? Let us know!
