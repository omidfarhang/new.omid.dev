The Telegraph, one of the [biggest newspapers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph) in the UK, hasn’t had a good time of it lately where their website is concerned. There were vulnerabilities found in relation to the site back in March involving [database access](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/09/telegraph_hack_attack/), and it seems a hacking group has gone in and defaced two subdomains.

These are the two subdomains in question:

shortbreaks(dot)telegraph.co.uk  
wine-and-dine(dot)telegraph.co.uk/site/index.php

They appear to have been compromised by “R.N.S. – Romanian National Security”. Here’s a screenshot, both defacements are identical:

Both pages play some music – “The Lonely Shepard”, from a .ru domain (you'll also notice a rather bizarre link to a Top Gear: Romania clip hosted on Youtube). I put the text into Google Translate and (of course) it isn’t perfect, but you’ll get the gist of it:

_“We tried to see how some “garbage” as you try to mock his country.  
Let us create a completely different picture from the real one, and calling us “Romanian Gypsies” disseminating gender issues still_

_If you had the nerve to angry an entire country, know that we will not stop here! Romania_

_Guess What, Gypsies aren't Romanians, morons.”  
_  
We’ve notified The Telegraph, and hopefully the pages will be back to normal soon.
