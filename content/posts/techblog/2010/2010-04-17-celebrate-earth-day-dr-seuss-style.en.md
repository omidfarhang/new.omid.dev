First published in 1971, _The Lorax_ was written by Dr. Seuss to teach children about the value of caring about the environment.

Like the other Dr. Seuss apps for the iPhone and iPad, the spirit of the characters and story are recreated for touch devices. And just like the other Dr. Seuss eBooks, the book can either be read aloud at a set pace, put in auto-play or readers can read and interact with the book on their own. The eBook costs $3.99.

[Lorax Garden for the iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lorax-garden/id366510234?mt=8) is $2.99 and while it will work with the iPad, it was designed for the iPhone. Lorax Garden is a game for young users that picks up where “The Lorax” ends and asks kids to replant Truffula Forest using the one remaining seed. 

You “plant” the trees by watering potted plants and growing flowers to earn extra “care” hearts that can make the trees grow faster. After repopulating the forest, e-mail postcards of the revitalized place can be sent from the app. The game is cute, but the replay value is pretty limited, so our vote is for _The Lorax_ eBook if you’re looking to expand your Dr. Seuss digital collection. 

Despite being written in an era that was far different from the world we live in now, _The Lorax_ remains a valuable and entertaining story and is a great way to bring the concept of “Going Green” to younger kids.
