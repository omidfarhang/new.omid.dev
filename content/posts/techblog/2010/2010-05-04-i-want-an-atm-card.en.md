When I was a child, I was fascinated by ATM machines. I had a savings account which my mother would deposit money regularly and I waited for the day that I could raid the account with the ATM card for frivolous spending on console games and fast food. 

Nigerians have developed a cunning method to transfer millions of dollars to lucky winners worldwide. Yes, it is indeed the humble ATM card.

As much as I love the idea, I thought that if I have to purchase a luxury car or property, I would have to make many visits to the ATM. However, losers canâ€™t be choosers. REV. HENRY UGOMA, please send me that ATM card now.
