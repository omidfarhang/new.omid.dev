Now, however, Mozilla’s Mike Beltzner has shared a presentation that reveals quite detailed plans for Firefox 4. HTML5 and CSS support are mentioned, as well as faster operation, a greater focus on security and stability, new developer tools, and a lot of personalization options. Furthermore, from the screenshots embedded in the presentation, we can see that the visuals from one year ago haven’t changed much, although most menu items (the home button, for example) are positioned differently. 

The plans, embedded below, sound fantastic, but Mozilla warns once again that they could change before Firefox 4 is finalized.![](http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyNzM1ODY5NjIxMDEmcHQ9MTI3MzU4NzMxMTExNiZwPTEwMTkxJmQ9c3NfZW1iZWQmZz*yJm89ODYwZjNlMjc4ZmZm/NGYwNTlmN2MzM2Q*YmVkMGU4M2Umb2Y9MA==.gif)
