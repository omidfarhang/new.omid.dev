Just one week after the 0-day became public and started to get exploited, an [update is available](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-22.html) to close the security hole. Even though Adobe Reader and Acrobat are affected (which are supposed to get an update in 2 weeks), until now we’ve only seen exploits against the Windows Flash Player.

Users and administrators should update their Flash Player as soon as possible! The version 10.1.85.3 fixes the issue for Windows, Unix, Solaris and is available through [Adobe’s download center](http://get.adobe.com/de/flashplayer/). Android users can get the update to 10.1.95.1 on the Android Market Place.
