Nokia would like the world to know that its upcoming smartphone, the N8, is finished. The first batch of devices has left the factories in Finland and China, and these N8s will soon end in the hands of customers all over the world.

Many Nokia fans have wondered will there be further delays for the N8, and this is probably the best answer to that question. Recently, Nokia informed some of the customers who have pre-ordered the device they will be receiving it “during October,” as Nokia decided to “hold the shipments for a few weeks to do some final amends.” However, Nokia immediately clarified that the N8 is not being delayed, and now it proved it with the pictures of N8s leaving the factory.

The high level of transparency from Nokia shows how important the N8 is for the Finnish mobile giant. In a blog post, Nokia explains that while the first users will get the Nokia N8 “before the weekend,” most will be receiving it “over the coming days and weeks.” It’ll be interesting to see if the Nokia N8 can justify the hype when it finally reaches end users.
