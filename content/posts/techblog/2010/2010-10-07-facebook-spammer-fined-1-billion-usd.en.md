**How does one say in French: “We're gonna make an example out of you, boy”**

The [Toronto Sun is reporting](http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/10/05/15595181.html) that convicted spammer Adam Guerbuez of Montreal has been ordered to pay $1 billion to Facebook by Quebec Superior Court. The court was upholding a U.S. Federal court fine that resulted from a wave of four million spam ads sent to Facebook users in 2008.

Guerbuez did not contest the Sept. 28 Quebec Superior Court ruling.

The Sun wrote: _“According to Facebook, Guerbuez fooled its users into providing him with their usernames and passwords. One method was the use of fake websites that posed as legitimate destinations._

_“After Guerbuez gained access to user’s personal profiles, he used computer programs to send out millions of messages promoting a variety of products, including marijuana and penis-enlargement products, Facebook said._

_“(Superior Court judge) Fournier wrote that Guerbuez has earned ‘very significant revenues’ from his online business.”_

Guerbuez appears to have maintained a very high public presence on his Web site adamguerbuez.com since 2008 and even scheduled a news conference today.

The site includes photos of the very substantial Guerbuez in casinos as well as shots of plates of food in what appears to be a very nice Montreal restaurant.

His first 2008 blog posts were to deny reports that police had raided his home and that he had an extensive criminal record.
