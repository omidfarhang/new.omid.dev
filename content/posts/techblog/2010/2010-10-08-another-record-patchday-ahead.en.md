Never before Microsoft released so many security bulletins on a Patchday.

Four of these security bulletins are rated critical by the company. Thus they allow attackers to inject malicious code into computers without user interaction.  Ten get the rating important, and another two are rated moderate.

Affected are all supported Windows operating systems from Windows XP to Windows 7 as well as Windows Server 2003 and 2008 – not only the 32-bit flavours, but also the 64-bit versions. Also, all Microsoft Office Versions starting from Office XP are vulnerable, including Office for Mac.

Administrators should plan on testing and approving the updates fast, as many of the vulnerabilities are critical. Users should apply the updates as soon as they are available.
