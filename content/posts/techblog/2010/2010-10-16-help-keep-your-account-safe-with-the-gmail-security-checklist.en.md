October is [National Cyber Security Awareness month](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/national-cyber-security-awareness-month.html) and a good time for a reminder about why hijackers do what they do and how you can protect your account. Check out the [Online Security blog](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2010/10/protecting-your-data-in-cloud.html) to learn about common hijacking techniques and security practices that will help you stay one step ahead of the bad guys. To help ensure your Gmail account is safe, take a minute to visit the Gmail help center and complete their new [security checklist](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=checklist.cs&tab=29488).
