Last mail I got from 12Seconds.com:

> Dear 12ers, 
> 
> Tonight at 8:15PM PST we will shut down [12seconds.tv](http://12seconds.tv/).
> 
> No videos can be recorded after 5PM PST.
> 
> If you have not yet downloaded your videos, go to [12seconds.tv](http://12seconds.tv/) and use the awesome 12seconds video export tool and save your memories. The tool will be available until 5:15 PM PST, so be sure to export your videos before then.
