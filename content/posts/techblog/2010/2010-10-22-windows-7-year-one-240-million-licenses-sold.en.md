**Windows 7 turns one year old and obviously Microsoft felt the need to once again brag with the performance of its latest operating system. And it can really brag as Windows 7 has sold 240 million licenses to date and is, hands down, the fastest selling OS in history.**

In September no less than 93% of all consumer PCs come pre-loaded with Windows 7, while on October 1st the OS' global market share was measured at 17%, putting it on second place behind the immortal Windows XP.

To celebrate Windows 7's birthday, Microsoft is inviting people to post in the [Windows Team Blog](http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2010/10/21/celebrating-windows-7-at-1-year-more-than-240-million-licenses-sold.aspx) a list of their favorite 7 things in Windows 7. Submissions are expected until October 27th, after which a winner will be chosen to receive a full copy of Windows 7 Ultimate and some nice stickers with Bing, IE9, Zune and others (as seen below).
