The app originated on the iPad and is now compatible with iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS and “recent” versions of the iPod touch.

The features include quick decoding of “almost every” video format, playback in landscape and portrait mode, as well as deleting files directly from the application (bypassing iTunes). Check out an early video review of the application over at [9to5Mac](http://www.9to5mac.com/32101/vlc-now-available-for-iphone).

The app is available for free in the [iTunes store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id390885556?mt=8#).
