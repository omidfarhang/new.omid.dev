To test out the new facility, Ncell also made the world’s highest video call at 17,388 feet.

So far, visitors of Mount Everest had to depend on satellite phones to make calls, but now they can do so through a standard GSM, 3G-enabled network. “The coverage of the network will reach up to the peak of the Everest,” Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen [said](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE69R2X420101028) to reporters in Kathmandu on Thursday.

Ncell is a joint venture between private investors and Sweden-based telecom [TeliaSonera](http://www.teliasonera.com/). Ncell’s network currently covers less than one-third of Nepal’s population, but TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $100 million in the next year to extend coverage to more than 90 percent of the country’s population.

“This achievement is as mighty as the altitude as 3G high speed internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services to the people living in the Khumbu Valley, trekkers, and climbers alike,” said TeliaSonera CEO Lars Nyberg.
