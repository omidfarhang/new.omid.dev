This vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Full details [here](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2458511.mspx).

Visit Microsoft's page [here](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2458511.mspx) to get full instructions. You can find the workarounds under the “Suggested Actions” twisty.

The workarounds include overriding the Web site CSS with a user-defined style sheet, deploying the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) for Internet Explorer 7 and setting Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones.
