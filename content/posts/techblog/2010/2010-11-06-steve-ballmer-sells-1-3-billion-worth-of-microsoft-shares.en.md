According to [a filing](http://secfilings.com/searchresultswide.aspx?link=1&filingid=7540020) with the SEC, Ballmer has sold 49.3 million Microsoft shares over the last three days, bringing his total ownership to 358.9 million shares, or approximately 4.2% of the company. Essentially, he sold 12% of his shares at a price between $26 and $28.

Knowing that the media would notice such a large transaction, Ballmer posted a statement on Microsoft’s [website](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2010/nov10/11-05statement.mspx), saying that he sold $1.3 billion in Microsoft shares for financial diversification and tax planning.

Here is Ballmer’s statement:

> “Even though this is a personal financial matter, I want to be clear about this to avoid any confusion. I am excited about our new products and the potential for our technology to change people’s lives, and I remain fully committed to Microsoft and its success.”

He additionally stated that he intends to sell more shares — up to 75 million — before the end of the year. That means he could potentially sell 25 million more shares of the company.

Perhaps by coincidence, Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates also [sold 1 million of shares](http://secfilings.com/searchresultswide.aspx?link=1&filingid=7539736), worth approximately $27.2 million.
