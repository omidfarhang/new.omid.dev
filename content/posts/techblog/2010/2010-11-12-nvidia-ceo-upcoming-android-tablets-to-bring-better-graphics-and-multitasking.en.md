But will these devices be able to compete with Apple’s iPad, which is currently dominating the market? According to NVidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, not only the new Android tablets will be competitive, they’ll be better than the iPad in many areas. 

Many of the upcoming tablets will be using NVidia's dual-core Tegra 2 processor, which will “give you the benefit of higher performance and much, much better multitasking and better graphics”, Huang said in an interview with [Cnet](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-20022471-64.html?part=rss&subj=news&tag=2547-1_3-0-20).

Huang is also very bullish on the tablet market in general. “Open your notebook. [Inside] it’s got heat pipes, and fans, and heat spreaders, lots of copper. You’re going to get rid of all of that”, he said. “[Tablets] will be quite disruptive to notebooks and entry-level desktops,” he said.

Interestingly enough, Huang was not exactly full of praise for the Samsung Galaxy Tab, which is currently one of the biggest competitors to Apple iPad. “Look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab. It’s a tablet that uses a phone operating system on a large display. A tablet is not a large phone”, he said.

This echoes the words of Hugo Barra, Google’s director of products for mobile, who recently said the current version of Android (Froyo, or Android 2.2) is “not optimized for use on tablets”, adding that Google is working on improving the Android experience for tablet computers. We can only hope that this new breed of Android tablets will deliver on the promises from Google and NVidia.
