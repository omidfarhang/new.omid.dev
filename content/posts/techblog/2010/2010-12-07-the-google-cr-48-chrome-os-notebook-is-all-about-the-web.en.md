And in doing so, it has declared war on the traditional desktop model. 

[<img title="5524" border="0" alt="5524" align="left" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TP7ExvViunI/AAAAAAAADcc/rwf42Jfac1k/5524_thumb%5B1%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="150" height="98" />](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_vaUVXcmC3OI/TP7Evv3E6wI/AAAAAAAADcY/1T-dmTgdDKM/s1600-h/5524%5B3%5D.jpg)The [Cr-48 Chrome Notebook](http://www.google.com/chromeos/pilot-program-cr48.html) will be the first official device featuring Chrome OS. Although it’s only being released in a pilot program to beta testers, it’s very much an emissary to consumers (Google’s hopeful allies in the fight). Those of you interested in enlisting can [sign up to test the device](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/cr48advanced/), but we’re guessing selection will be — well — selective.

Not much is known about the hardware driving Google’s new machine, but here is what we do know:

  * 12-inch LCD display 
  * Built-in Wi-Fi and 3G (service provided by Verizon Wireless) 
  * Full-sized keyboard with no caps-lock or function keys 
  * Oversized clickable touchpad 
  * Weighs in at 3.8 pounds 
  * Solid state hard drive — capacity unknown 
  * Eight hours of active usage with a week of standby power 

The Cr-48 Chrome Notebook might not be the most powerful computing device, but that’s not the point. The device is intended for consumption, not raw processing power. Whether it performs as a consumption device remains to be seen, but if Google gets this right, [Chrome OS](http://www.google.com/chromeos/) notebooks could put a serious hurt on devices like the MacBook Air.
