In addition to telling companies not to mention their Google TV products at CES next month, now it looks like the search company is actively stopping production on a device that's already been released.

According to a report on Digitimes.com, Logitech has ordered a suspension of all Logitech Revue components from its supplier, Gigabyte Technology. The Revue is Logitech's set-top box that turns any TV into a Google TV.

While Logitech isn't commenting on the product suspension, rumors are now circulating that it's because of Google's intervening.

After the Revue, as well as Sony's Google TV-enabled Internet TV, received mediocre reviews and lackluster sales, Google appears to want to go back to the drawing board. Next month's CES was supposed to be a grand celebration of the new television platform, but now Google TV will be notably absent.

TV companies like Toshiba and LG will have to make last-minute changes to their CES lineup, at the request of Google.

Digitimes reports that Logitech has only requested a suspension of its component sales until later in January. What Google could possibly hope to accomplish in just one month is anyone's guess.
