The service was placed on the market in December after a [meeting](http://thenextweb.com/industry/2010/12/16/looks-like-yahoos-about-to-have-a-massive-clean-up/) to discuss Yahoo’s future direction. After a heated bidding process, the site has reportedly been sold to a rival bookmarking service – who exactly we’re unsure of but we’ll update once we have confirmation. We do know its been sold to an existing competitor with “strong user base.”

If the $5 million figure is true, it’s [more than](http://twitter.com/#!/Jason/status/15814220662710272) many believed the site to be worth but a hefty loss on Yahoo’s rumored $18m purchase price in 2005 from founder [Joshua Schachter](http://twitter.com/#!/joshu).

We’ve contacted Yahoo and current Delicious developers for confirmation and will update once we’ve heard back. In the mean time, while we dig further, [check out these Delicious alternatives](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/16/the-5-best-alternatives-to-delicious/).

**Update:** We’ve gotten a reply from Yahoo which, sadly, is not much of a reply.

> Hello-

> As we have said in the past, we are actively thinking about the future of Delicious and believe there is a home outside the company that would make more sense for the service, our users and our shareholders.

There is, of course, the adage that a non-denial is as good as a confirmation but that’s not a jump that we’re willing to take, just yet.
