Fulfilling the hints Microsoft [dropped back in March](http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft-hints-at-Internet-Explorer-10-previews-for-MIX11-in-April/1299689497), the Redmond software company unveiled the first platform preview of Internet Explorer 10 at MIX 11 in Las Vegas on Tuesday.

This first preview of Internet Explorer 10 builds on the big HTML5 push that began with IE9, and adds support for more advanced Web standards, such as CSS3 Gradients as background images, and CSS3 Flexible Box and multi-column layout.

Microsoft said code refreshes will take place approximately every twelve weeks for IE10.

As usual, Internet Explorer's new tricks can be checked out atÂ [ie.microsoft.com/testdrive](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/) right now.
