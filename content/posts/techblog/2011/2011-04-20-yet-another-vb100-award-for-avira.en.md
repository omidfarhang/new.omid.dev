**Avira TechBlog:** The series continues â€“ Avira AntiVir Personal and Avira AntiVir Professional received the April 2011 VB100 award! The tests were executed in a Windows XP SP3 environment by the [Virus Bulletin](http://www.virusbtn.com/index) test engineers.

The Avira anti malware solutions performed very well: All WildList samples were detected, all of the polymorphic viruses too. Also, more than 99 percent of the Worms and Bots were blocked. The heuristics test also looks very good: With 96 percent of the yet unknown malware samples filtered out Avira ranks among the best solutions!
