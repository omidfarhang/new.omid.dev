**Schneier on Security:** It's hard to know how serious [this](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/china-news/slip-up-in-chinese-military-tv-show-reveals-more-than-intended-60619.html) really is:

> The screenshots appear as B-roll footage in the documentary for six seconds­between 11:04 and 11:10 minutes — showing custom built Chinese software apparently launching a cyber-attack against the main website of the Falun Gong spiritual practice, by using a compromised IP address belonging to a United States university. As of Aug. 22 at 1:30pm EDT, in addition to [Youtube](http://ept.ms/oxUW6k), the whole documentary is [available on the CCTV website](http://military.cntv.cn/program/jskj/20110717/100139.shtml).
> 
> The screenshots show the name of the software and the Chinese university that built it, the Electrical Engineering University of China's People's Liberation Army­direct evidence that the PLA is involved in coding cyber-attack software directed against a Chinese dissident group.
> 
> The software window says “Choose Attack Target.” The computer operator selects an IP address from a list­it happens to be 138.26.72.17­and then selects a target. Encoded in the software are the words “Falun Gong website list,” showing that attacking Falun Gong websites was built into the software.
> 
> A drop-down list of dozens of Falun Gong websites appears. The computer operator chooses Minghui.org, the main website of the Falun Gong spiritual practice.
> 
> The IP address [138.26.72.17](http://www.ip-adress.com/whois/uab.edu) belongs to the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB), according to an online trace.
> 
> The shots then show a big “Attack” button on the bottom left being pushed, before the camera cuts away.
