Of course you shouldn't click on any of these links unless you want to line the pockets of the bad guys. 

But it's not just spam, in previous years we've reported on Valentine Facebook scams, SMS scams and malicious ecards targeting the romantics among us. 

Remember to always be suspicious of unsolicited emails carrying links and attachments. 

And don't get swept away in the moment and click on something you shouldn't, or you might be left with something nasty long after the love has gone.
