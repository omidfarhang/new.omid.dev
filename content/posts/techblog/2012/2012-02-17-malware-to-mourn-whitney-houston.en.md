**Symantec:** The world is mourning the loss of another legendary pop singer also known as the queen of pop â€“ Whitney Houston. Spammers are paying homage to the icon with a wicked malware. The malicious email shows a video of the last appearance of the star in a Los Angeles night club and also downloads an executable binary. This file is detected by Symantec Antivirus as [WS.Reputation.1](http://securityresponse.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-051308-1854-99&vid=4294919973).
