**SophosLabs:** Here's a spam message I received today: 

[<img title="south-africa-spam" border="0" alt="south-africa-spam" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-QPxCCplH1eo/Tz5hpOxA90I/AAAAAAAAE18/i9qHyjXG6AM/south-africa-spam_thumb%25255B2%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="498" height="417" />](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-1196lZI2rTE/Tz5hh_VOeoI/AAAAAAAAE10/rjao42HY-gw/s1600-h/south-africa-spam%25255B4%25255D.jpg) 

<tt>Hi GCLULEY,</tt>

Hi. Why the caps? And just “Graham” would be fine. 

<tt>Do you find ONLY having a South African passport limiting?</tt>

I don't have a South African passport, but I haven't found its absence very limiting. 

<tt>Do you find your travel choices abroad restricting and visa applications frustrating?</tt>

Not particularly. 

<tt>Do you have an exit strategy if South Africa becomes the next Zimbabwe?</tt>

An exit strategy from where? The UK? No, I haven't really thought about it. 

<tt>Do you feel like you are paying too much tax in South Africa?</tt>

Any tax I'm paying in South Africa is definitely too much. 

When I clicked on the link I was taken to a page on a build-your-own-form website which insisted I hand over my full name, email address, cellphone number, age, family income, and location before it would share any more information.

I chose not to share any of my personal information – and not just because I'm not based in South Africa. 

If these spammers want to get a higher return on their email campaign they might want to try targeting just South African internet users in future. 

Be careful out there.
