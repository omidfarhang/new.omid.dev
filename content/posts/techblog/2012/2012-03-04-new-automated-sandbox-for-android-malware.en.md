<a href="http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=12703&#038;rss" target="_blank"><strong>ISC Diary</strong></a>**:** One of the things that I've been working on lately is building an automated malware analysis environment to handle Android malware similar to [the one I built for Windows malware](http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/tools/building-automated-behavioral-malware-analysis-environment-open-source-software_33129).  I'm not quite there yet, but I was quite pleased to here about the new service being offered by the folks at Die Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg.  This is still a research project, so if you choose to use it, be understanding.  Don't expect 24&#215;7 uptime and let's try not to DoS them.  That said, I'm looking forward to seeing how well it works and how the dynamic analysis will work once it is actually in production.
