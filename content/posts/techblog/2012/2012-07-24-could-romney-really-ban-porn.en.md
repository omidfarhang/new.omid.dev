> “Computer pornography has given new meaning to the words ‘home invasion,’” [Romney said](http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/gop1007/romney102007sp.html) at a 2007 Values Voter summit, “If I am President, I will work to make sure that every computer sold into the home has an easy to engage pornography filter so that every parent can protect their child from unwanted filth.” Federal obscenity laws used to prosecute porn moguls, such as [Hustler’s Larry Flynt_](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/13/us/flynt-pleads-guilty-in-ohio-obscenity-case.html), have largely [been limited to child pornography](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/features/2007/american_lawbreaking/how_laws_die.html) since the rise of the Internet, but there’s an open debate as to whether they could be reactivated.
