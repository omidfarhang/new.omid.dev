Please be aware that this release is not available from the Product Download Center (<http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer>) which will continue to provide 11.3.300.268.  We realize that this might cause confusion for some users.  Due to the severity of this issue, we decided to make this build available immediately to help customers affected by this bug.  Due to logistical issues and time constraints, we were unable to update the release on the Product Download Center.  The next release of Flash Player will correct this disparity.  Please note that unless you have been affected by the FlashPlayerUpdateService.exe crash, both 11.3.300.270 and 11.3.300.268 will be functionally identical. 

This release will be distributed using the following methods: 

  * Silent auto update – If enabled and functional, the silent auto update service will automatically install this build within 24 hours. 
  * Direct download – You can download the installers directly using the links below 
      * [Flash Player for ActiveX (Internet Explorer)](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/current/support/install_flash_player_ax.exe) 
      * [Flash Player Plug-In (All other browsers)](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/current/support/install_flash_player.exe)
  * Flash Player Distribution page for distribution license agreement holders
