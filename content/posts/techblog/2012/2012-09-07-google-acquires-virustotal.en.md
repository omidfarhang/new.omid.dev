This is what we read in latest post from VirusTotal in their blog:

<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vKajg7dM7do/UEpOXEKhBeI/AAAAAAAAHXg/CzWAKwAdjFM/s1600-h/vt-blog-logo%25255B2%25255D.png" target="_blank"><img title="vt-blog-logo" border="0" alt="vt-blog-logo" align="right" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-6jzOYP2iOgg/UEpOaoYvdYI/AAAAAAAAHXo/sfh5bHhdSPc/vt-blog-logo_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="288" height="100" /></a>Our goal is simple: to help keep you safe on the web. And we’ve worked hard to ensure that the services we offer continually improve. But as a small, resource-constrained company, that can sometimes be challenging. So we’re delighted that Google, a long-time partner, has acquired VirusTotal. This is great news for you, and bad news for malware generators, because:

  * The quality and power of our malware research tools will keep improving, most likely faster; and
  * Google’s infrastructure will ensure that our tools are always ready, right when you need them.  

VirusTotal will continue to operate independently, maintaining our partnerships with other antivirus companies and security experts. This is an exciting step forward. Google has a long track record working to keep people safe online and we look forward to fighting the good fight together with them.
