The Stable Channel update closes seven security vulnerabilities, three of them rated High, and includes bug fixes. New stable Chrome versions for iOS and Android have also been released and include minor improvements. The iOS version of the browser now supports Apple's Passbook application. 

The [update](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/11/stable-channel-update.html) to the Stable version of Chrome for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Chrome Frame (for running Chrome inside of Internet Explorer) brings it to version 23.0.1271.91. The update closes a security vulnerability in the Mac OS X version of the browser that is caused by a severe rendering bug with the operating system's driver for Intel graphics cards. This problem was rated by Google as High priority, as was a buffer underflow problem in libxml and a use-after-free bug in the browser's SVG filters, which have also been fixed. 

The Beta Channel of Chrome for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Chrome Frame has been [updated](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/11/beta-channel-update_27.html) to version 24.0.1312.25, which includes a number of bug fixes for running applications within the browser, fixes stability issues, and solves two problems with the taskbar in Windows 8.

In the Developer Channel, Chrome for Windows, Mac OS X and Chrome Frame has been [updated](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/dev-channel-update_28.html) to version 25.0.1337.0 which includes [a number](http://goo.gl/M6eQo) of fixes and improvements, most noticeably improvements to the Live Tiles functionality for Windows 8 and bug fixes for Flash on Mac OS X. Chrome for the Chrome OS Developer Channel is now [at version 25.0.1324.1](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/dev-channel-update-for-chrome-os_28.html), which includes a firmware update. 

Chrome for iOS has been [updated](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/chrome-for-ios-update.html) to version 23.0.1271.91 which has introduced the ability to open PDFs in other applications and enables users to save their airline boarding passes and tickets in Apple's Passbook. The update also brings some security and stability improvements. Chrome for Android [is now at](http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/chrome-for-android-update_28.html) version 18.0.1025469 on ARM and version 18.0.1026322 on x86 devices; both updates fix stability issues.

The listing includes download links for the different versions of the browser. All versions of Chrome should update themselves automatically; on some mobile platforms the user will be prompted to perform the update.
