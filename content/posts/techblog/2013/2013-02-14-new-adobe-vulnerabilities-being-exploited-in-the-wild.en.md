Adobe is currently investigating this issue. 

According to the [FireEye blog](http://blog.fireeye.com/research/2013/02/in-turn-its-pdf-time.html) posted earlier today, the malicious file arrives as a PDF file. Upon successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities, two malicious DLL files are dropped. 

Symantec detects the malicious PDF file as [Trojan.Pidief](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2009-121708-1022-99) and the two dropped DLL files as [Trojan Horse](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2004-021914-2822-99). 

We are currently investigating the possibility of further protections for these vulnerabilities and will provide an update to this blog when possible. 

A subsequent [advisory](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/advisories/apsa13-02.html) posted by Adobe indicates the following versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat are vulnerable: 

  * Adobe Reader XI (11.0.01 and earlier) for Windows and Macintosh 
  * Adobe Reader X (10.1.5 and earlier) for Windows and Macintosh 
  * Adobe Reader 9.5.3 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows and Macintosh 
  * Adobe Acrobat XI (11.0.01 and earlier) for Windows and Macintosh 
  * Adobe Acrobat X (10.1.5 and earlier) for Windows and Macintosh 
  * Adobe Acrobat 9.5.3 and earlier 9.x versions for Windows and Macintosh
