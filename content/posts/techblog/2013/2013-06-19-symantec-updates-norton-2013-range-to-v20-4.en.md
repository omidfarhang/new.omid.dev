### [![NIS Icon](/images/2013/06/NIS-e1371815807148.png)](/images/2013/06/NIS-e1371815807148.png)Symantec has updated its suite of Windows security products with the release of Norton Antivirus 2013 v20.4, Norton Internet Security 2013 v20.4 and Norton 360 2013 v20.4.

Version 20.4 is primarily a bug-fix release, with some notable fixes, but also tweaks the user interface.

One visible change for users who also have [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Free](/en/knowledge-base/programs/malwarebytes-antimalware/) installed as additional protection is a fix that prevents Norton from blocking or flagging up MBAM as incompatible.

The latest update also resolves an issue where the Safe Web annotations for checking search results for safety and privacy were not appearing in the US version of Google.com. Also corrected is an issue whereby Intrusion Prevention was incorrectly flagged as switched off when Norton AntiSpam was being opened from Microsoft Outlook.

English users will find a new widget – Backup – has been added to the main product page, while the Norton Safe Web widget has been removed, although it continues to function and appear within all compatible web browsers. The Backup widget refers to Symantec’s cloud backup, sync and sharing solution, currently called Norton Zone.

Two other fixes include making buttons in high-contrast mode more visible and ensuring the Scan Items tab scroll bar always appears.
