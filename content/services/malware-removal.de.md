If your computer is infected with malwares or viruses (or even if you are in doubt if your computer has malware or not) first you can try to follow my [malware removal guide](/en/knowledge-base/malware-removal/ "Malware Removal").

But if you failed to complete the malware removal process or if you cannot do it yourself, I will try to disinfect your systems.

This service is free and will cost you nothing, malware removal process will be done through [Remote Assistant](/en/services/remote-assistant/) connection and it need your computer being able to boot up and connect to internet.

To schedule a session, please visit [Contact Me]({{< ref "/contact-me" >}}) and tell me about the problem you have, try to add as much information as possible. I will get back to you with future information for scheduling a meeting and what you need to do to prepare.
