After launch of your website I will be always available to update, maintain and develop new features for your website.

What happens when you need to add a new feature to your website? Maybe you want a new landing page with creative layers or maybe a new contact form which automatically add new contacts into your mailing lists. These are stuff which you may learn how to do by spending sometime, but it's a better and wise idea to let a web developer do them for you.

I've years of experience in this field and dealing with different problems and challenges with many websites so you can trust me for your small and medium projects. For general and periodical maintenance of your website, it will cost you $10 per hour or set a flat price for whole project. You can contact me to set a time and talk about your needs via [Contact Me]({{< ref "/contact-me" >}}) page.
