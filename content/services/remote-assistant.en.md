If you have a technical problem that you are unable to solve it yourself, I will try to solve it for you, not all problems can be solved via remote access since some of them need physical access or boot into special environments that remote connections wont work there, but usually problems like broken programs, malware infections and common maintenance can be done via remote connections.
